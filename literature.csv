Known as Subarashiki Hibi in Japan, Wonderful Everyday is a bizarre, existential trip of varying genres and viewpoints: what begins a tropey anime slice of life story turns into a surreal murder mystery, and finally a Bildungsroman with themes of identity and the meaning of happiness.

Constant throughout the narrative are allusions to Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus - which informs the central themes of connection between the self and the perception of the world. Other philosopical and literary works are also tightly integrated into the narrative; including but not limited to: Cyrano de Bergerac, Critique of Pure Reason, and the poetry of Emily Dickinson.

Be warned that some early parts of the story are frustratingly slow, and seemingly lacking in the philosopical backbone of other sections of the narrative; but you will later realize their purpose in the overall thesis of the work. Another aspect to be worried about is 18+ content; including various forms of rape.

However, all of these potential setbacks are worth it, for a thought provoking, literary, and ultimately optimistic Visual Novel masterpiece. I honestly believe this might be looked back on as one of the best works of the 2010s - it is something I have thought about everyday.

I finished it no more than 15 minuets ago, in that time I sucked down at least three cigarettes and I'm lighting the fourth as I'm typing this. 

This is a tremendous story about many things. It's a story about promises. A story about war. A story about rape. A story about the horrible atrocities humans are capable of committing. Most importantly (for me) it's a story about love in the face of all of those atrocities. Mouawad's ability to articulate such gut-wrenching events and still leave the reader with a sort of strange upliftment is unbelievable. I think this fact speaks directly to the heart of the story. To explain why I think that I will quote the play and continue to explain afterwards:

&gt; Nihad: ...No beat, no sense of showbiz. That's where I find my dignity... A little red nose. A little clown nose. What does it mean? My personal dignity is a funny face left by the woman who gave birth to me.



&gt; Nawal: *(in the letter to the twins)* Are you smiling? If you are smiling, don't stifle your laughter. Because I don't stifle mine. It's the laughter of rage.

To me, the theme of love or laughter in the face of horrible events is clear in just these two quotes. Nihad is doning a clown nose at the end of a statement about the atrocities he committed, a sort of ironic visualization of the theme of love or laughter in the face of atrocities. Nawal almost says it directly with the ""laughter of rage"" line. Laughter and rage or love and cruelty are naturally juxtaposed by their definitions, but Mouawad cleverly weaves them together which is why I think at the end of this play the reader is (at least I was) left with an uncomfortable feeling of upliftment and horror simultaneously. 

Honestly *brilliant*. 

***

I think that's all I can think of to write about this play, but I intend to read it again soon to try to pick it apart some more. 

A few questions for those who have read it:

- Would you agree with my haphazardly constructed analysis of what I think to be one of the core themes of the play?

- Are there other themes that you think ride higher or are more prominent/important than that of ""love in the face of atrocities""?

- How many boxes of tissues did you go through?

I'm going to go crawl in bed with my dog and cry for a while now. 

Edit: I'd love it if people said something about why they downvoted, instead of just downvoting and moving on. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never been so emotionally effected by a piece of literature. I finished it no more than 15 minuets ago, in that time I sucked down at least three cigarettes and I&amp;#39;m lighting the fourth as I&amp;#39;m typing this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a tremendous story about many things. It&amp;#39;s a story about promises. A story about war. A story about rape. A story about the horrible atrocities humans are capable of committing. Most importantly (for me) it&amp;#39;s a story about love in the face of all of those atrocities. Mouawad&amp;#39;s ability to articulate such gut-wrenching events and still leave the reader with a sort of strange upliftment is unbelievable. I think this fact speaks directly to the heart of the story. To explain why I think that I will quote the play and continue to explain afterwards:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nihad: ...No beat, no sense of showbiz. That&amp;#39;s where I find my dignity... A little red nose. A little clown nose. What does it mean? My personal dignity is a funny face left by the woman who gave birth to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nawal: &lt;em&gt;(in the letter to the twins)&lt;/em&gt; Are you smiling? If you are smiling, don&amp;#39;t stifle your laughter. Because I don&amp;#39;t stifle mine. It&amp;#39;s the laughter of rage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, the theme of love or laughter in the face of horrible events is clear in just these two quotes.

Laughter and rage or love and cruelty are naturally juxtaposed by their definitions, but Mouawad cleverly weaves them together which is why I think at the end of this play the reader is (at least I was) left with an uncomfortable feeling of upliftment and horror simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly &lt;em&gt;brilliant&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

Which generally got a pretty negative reaction. 

This surprised me: I was uttering an opinion which is not unique and I offered some justification for it. Given there are no right and wrong answers in literature, I didn't expect to meet with quite so much dismay. Perhaps I didn't give enough explanation.

Well, I've now finished it. I'm very glad I did: it's a unique book which bought me a lot of pleasure. That said, the opinions I expressed in my previous thread have not changed significantly. Some chapters are challenging, but rewarding. But whether they are rewarding enough for the effort is a moot point, especially the ones that demand significant external knowledge to enjoy. And there are a couple which are simply boring, almost for the sake of it. At times it feels like Joyce was simply packing the book just in order to follow the Odyssey. 

Anyway, to further stimulate discussion and back up my opinion, here's a chapter breakdown of my brief opinions.

1 &amp; 2 - these are essentially standard novel format, albeit in Joyce's unique lyrical style. I found them very enjoyable and engaging.

3 - is very difficult, so early in the book. But it's an education in how powerful and deep stream of consciousness can be in character exploration, and a fascinating indication of how inventive Joyce was with the format and the language.

4 - back to standard novel format again, but still with the lovely lyricism, and the exploration of Bloom is wonderfully rich and human. It's exciting, at this point, to imagine spending the rest of the novel with him.

5 - Although perfectly readable, this chapter is really quite dull. We learn a little about Bloom's sexual peccadilloes but not much more, to my mind, of value. Having built up enthusiasm for Bloom, this chapter wastes it.

6 - I got a lot of stick for criticising this chapter, so I went back and re-read it. And yes, it's richer and deeper than I remembered. Bloom's musing upon mortality and his dead son are emotionally arresting, and his interactions in the carriage are important in marking him as an outsider, the ""wandering Jew"". I think perhaps it suffers from being sandwiched between two very dull chapters. Which brings me to ...

7 - is terrible, the worst, most tedious bit of the whole novel. I almost gave up in the middle of this. Joyce seems very pleased with his conceit of weaving a narrative in a newspaper office around headlines and use of rhetorical flourishes. But really, nothing of value happens and we learn nothing about the characters we didn't already know. 

8 - we're back on track, pushing deeper into Bloom's psyche again, with some fine writing exploring humanities relationship with its animal instincts.

9 - I have mixed feelings about this. If you know Hamlet, you'll likely enjoy the fine piece of literary criticism at the center of the chapter. I do, and I did. I find it difficult, though, that Joyce chose to build a whole chapter of the novel around Shakespeare. Whatever the value, it's deliberately elitist. 

10 - the second point at which I almost gave up. Initially there's a lot of fun to be had with the new characters introduced, often drawn with detached humour, and with the technical challenge of routing them round the city. But it gets old after a while, and increasingly confusing, to no great value. We'll not meet a number of these characters again.

11 - this is perhaps the chapter which best exemplifies ""difficult but rewarding"". It's absolutely lovely to read, especially if you sound it out in your head, and the devices of musicality which Joyce employs are sometimes breathtaking in their originality. But at the same time, as the chapter wore on I completely lost the thread of the narrative. For the first time I had to consult a chapter summary to work out what was going on.

12 - my favourite chapter, as it turns out. A delight. Full of clever and entertaining play on both words and metaphors to do with being poked in the eye, and a fine deconstructions of both the of Irish nationalism, its culture and its history. Now, this is a subject with which I'm vaguely familiar and I couldn't help but wonder: maybe I'm missing symbolism in other chapters that would make them just as enjoyable for me, if I saw it? Having now finished and read some more notes on the book, I suspect not. But I can't be sure.

13 - another hugely enjoyable ride, making fun at the expense of the classic mass romance.

14 - the third time I almost put the book aside. It's very clever, sure, but no-one except literature graduates are going to get what Joyce is attempting to do here, or appreciate the work he must have put in to achieve it with such skill. For the rest of us, we're left with an almost unreadable narrative which contains some important plot points. This is literary elitism and snobbery at its absolute worst. 

15 - much like chapter 10, this is fun for a while, but outstays its welcome and becomes a bore. It's more engaging than chapter 10 because it's so inventive, both in form and in detail. Exploring the character's psyche through the form of a hallucinogenic play is brilliant.  You get the sense Joyce really enjoyed writing it but finally saw it was too long and rushed the end. 

16 - enjoyed the way this chapter blends style, narrative and character development together in order to communicate its theme of confusion and exhaustion.

17 - my second favourite chapter, a tour-de-force of inventive style, punctuated with some quite brilliant lyrical inventions. The Q&amp;A format is so flexible, it makes me wonder why it hasn't been used more in the novel format, following Joyce.

18 - a powerful close, stylistically inventive and such a rich, brilliant exploration of a female character, especially by a male author.

&amp;#x200B;

So there we have it. I still feel there are many chapters which would benefit from being shorter - much shorter in some cases. I'd advise anyone who wants to read it to try and, if they hit difficulties, to simply skip a chapter, read a plot summary, and start the next one. There's too much brilliance here to let the turgid, elitist elements turn you off.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half way through the book, I splurged out some of my frustrations with it here, in this thread: &lt;/p&gt;

I am sharing my interesting discoveries and look forward to hearing your point of view on this most beloved of Indian plays.

Indian classical drama recognizes the nature of aesthetic experience in terms of ‘RASA.’ Rasa refers to the emotive content of a work of literature in the Sanskrit tradition. 

The play begins as a ‘Drishya Kavya’ (visual poetry) rich in imagery and laden with beautiful poetry opens in Kanva’s hermitage, where ‘Nisarga-Kanya’(daughter of nature) Sakuntala reared by the Sakunta birds lives and enjoys a Wordsworthian intimacy with all Nature’s aspects, features and moods. 

Rasa theory comprises ‘NAVARASAS’ (nine rasas): ‘Sringara’ (love/eroticism), ‘Hasya’ (laughter), ‘Raudra’ (anger), ‘Karuna’ (mercy), ‘Bhibatsa’(disgust), ‘Bhayanaka’(horror), ‘Veera’(heroism), ‘Adbhuta’(wonder) and ‘Santa’ (peace) 

Kalidasa chose ‘Sringara rasa’ and and focussed on developing its emotional possibilities.

In Act 1, King Dusyanta, a symbol of passion and ‘Veera rasa’ disrupts Sakuntala’s Utopian existence as he introduces ‘Kama rasa’ which emphasises sexuality as connected with procreation. 

The bees sucking honey from the summer blossoms hint that Dusyanta is the bee who has come to woo Sakuntala; thus introducing ‘Sringara rasa.’

Rasa, here, is created when the reader is able to identify himself with the character via the aids of the Vibhavas (emotive situation in human setting) and Bhavas (furnishing moods which produce Rasa).  RASANUBHAVA roughly corresponds to the state of the experience of Rasa.

Act II and more importantly Act III which ends in consummation, portray ‘Rajas’ (passion). The churning of cream into butter (a symbol for creation) and references to mango blossom (a symbol of womanhood) and allusions to Kama’s five different kinds of flowered arrows reinforce the ‘Sringara rasa.’

Sringara rasa can be sub divided into:
	love forbidden (in the first two acts)
	love in separation (in the fourth, fifth, and sixth acts)
	love in union (overall)

Dusyanta errs by marrying Sakuntala (Gandharva vivaha) in her father Kanva’s absence and without his permission. Dusyanta leaves behind his wife Sakuntala at the hermitage with only his ‘token’ ring and embryonic son.

A forlorn Sakuntala personifies ‘Karuna rasa’ as she is lost in ‘Shoka bhava’ (grief) and fails in her ascetic duty (Dharma) to perform ‘Shodashopacharas’ and honour the guest Durvasa; calling at the hermitage. Angry Durvasa pronounces the ‘Shyap’ (curse) that the person in whose memory she was engrossed would forget her.

Sakuntala neglected her legitimate duty just as Dusyanta lapsed in his moral obligations to make provision for his wife. Thus, Durvasa’s curse provides the interval for both Sakuntala and Dusyanta to purify themselves for their lapses. 

Act IV depicts Sakuntala’s departure from the hermitage as Nature bids her a fond farewell on her way to Dusyanta’s palace.

In Act V Dusyanta displays ‘Tamas’ (ignorance) as he fails to remember Sakuntala who has lost his ring en route and cruelly repudiates her.
	
In Act VI, the token ring reclaimed from the fisherman frees Dusyanta from the curse who now grieves at having dismissed his pregnant wife.

Act VII sees Dusyanta reconciled with Sakuntala through their precocious son Sarvadamana.

Sakuntala and Dusyanta’s reunion in Maricha’s hermitage is a matter of deep conjugal love, as their love polluted by the rashness of youth (Rajas/passion) has become refined by duty and chastened by suffering into Sattva/reason.

Here, RASOTPATTI, the evocation of Rasa is achieved as Sakuntala now personifies the ideal Hindu woman, the cornerstone of whose existence is motherhood and spirituality.

Dusyanta meanwhile resolves the tension inherent between the “Four Purusarthas” (aims of man), Dharma (duty), Artha (wealth), Kama (desire) and Moksha (salvation). 

He learns that the ideal life is the life of the golden mean, of mutually tempered duty (Dharma) and desire (Kama) which co-exist in a peaceful and balanced state.

Thus, Sakuntala and Dusyanta achieve spiritual equilibrium fulfilling the aim of Indian drama.

The play typifies the ideal dramatic plot which when interpreted within the framework of Hindu metaphysical theory suggests a circular development of theme, as it begins and ends on a note of poise in ‘Santa Rasa.’

This primacy of Rasa in Indian theory and the affirmative quality of Indian philosophy does not allow the scope of tragedy but only drama.

There are a lot of different ways to take the novel, since it seems so directionless and disjointed, so I'm interested what other people thought of it. To me though, the novel is a revel in the absolute futility of literature. Which sounds like nonsense, especially considering most of the characters are poets, critics, novelists, publishers and whatnot, but everything about the structure convinces me that none of the characters ever grasp the reality they seek, and have found contentment in that.

You can look at Ulises Lima and Arturo Belano as the opposite of this, the ""artists"" that no one wants to be. They're the founders of the Visceral Realists, a movement with no clear aim but believing that true realism needs something more that no art has ever achieved before. They rarely produce any writing, establish awards in the name of unknown writers, print a magazine with an unknown publisher, idolize one poet (Cesarea Tinajero) who may not even exist. They're the joke of established poets and publishers everywhere. And unlike established poets, they're unsatisfied with the state of literature all around the world. They brush off Paz, Neruda, Borges, etc. for no discernible reason, and end up kicking most people out of the Visceral Realist movement for being too sympathetic of poetry as it is. When asked why they do this, they're incapable of giving a reason. They are, by most definitions, very bad poets.

However, other characters pay attention to them because they believe Lima and Belano act in ways that are literarily interesting. They travel the world seeking what they believe to be the purest form of art, which other characters find admirable to some degree. Octavio Paz's meeting with Lima reveals that even the most legendary of modern Latin American poets admires Visceral Realism, even though the tension between their philosophies on art are so strong that all Paz and Lima do is walk miserably in circles around each other. Neither will reach the heart of reality with their art, and believe in Visceral Realism as the next step toward unknowing. This is why the works by Lima and Belano are never shown to the reader; their poetry has nothing to teach. Their real poetry is their embodiment of the values of literature within themselves. And while a lesser novel would make characters like this seem godlike and impossible the understand (or, better yet, non-existent), the novel makes them real people, who consistently fail on their journey. The immortalized Cesarea Tinajero is treated the same way, who turns out to be a washmaid in the middle of the desert whose eyes soak up all the light around her. Whether this means Visceral Realism failed is ultimately nebulous; Lima, Belano, and Tinajero are unsatisfied with their work, but their work demonstrates that no measure of embodiment (even to the point of drawing the universe into your eyes) can achieve a pure art.

One character comes close in the form of Juan Garcia Madero. After Lima and Belano leave him and Lupe in the desert, his journal shows him to go on living in impossible conditions for about a month. He too has given up on Visceral Realism, but he ends his journal making bizarre entries involving place names and windows. So with the ""What's outside the window?"" bit; I think the window is a boundary between the reality of the novel and that of the reader. So much of the book is about how audiences see art, and how ridiculous it is that art aims to be anything when so many people see art differently (i.e. the chapter where each narrator ends a story by saying ""Every story that starts as a comedy ends as _______""). The Visceral Realists act in such nonsensical ways that they cannot reason for, as they try to reject reason as a concept. Rejection of reason acknowledges the futility of interpreting art, and opens art to all possible perspectives. The perforation in the window at the end is the result of this opening; the perception of art more and more as like our own reality, excruciating, never quite there.

I've barely scratched the surface of how complex these themes get in the novel, and I got really excited writing about it so most of this post probably doesn't make much sense. I'm just excited to hear other people's perspectives on it, especially since, to me, that's the main point of the book.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I recently finished reading &lt;em&gt;The Savage Detectives&lt;/em&gt;, which is one of the best books I&amp;#39;ve read in a long time.

&lt;p&gt;However, other characters pay attention to them because they believe Lima and Belano act in ways that are literarily interesting. They travel the world seeking what they believe to be the purest form of art, which other characters find admirable to some degree. Octavio Paz&amp;#39;s meeting with Lima reveals that even the most legendary of modern Latin American poets admires Visceral Realism, even though the tension between their philosophies on art are so strong that all Paz and Lima do is walk miserably in circles around each other. Neither will reach the heart of reality with their art, and believe in Visceral Realism as the next step toward unknowing. This is why the works by Lima and Belano are never shown to the reader; their poetry has nothing to teach. Their real poetry is their embodiment of the values of literature within themselves. And while a lesser novel would make characters like this seem godlike and impossible the understand (or, better yet, non-existent), the novel makes them real people, who consistently fail on their journey. The immortalized Cesarea Tinajero is treated the same way, who turns out to be a washmaid in the middle of the desert whose eyes soak up all the light around her. Whether this means Visceral Realism failed is ultimately nebulous; Lima, Belano, and Tinajero are unsatisfied with their work, but their work demonstrates that no measure of embodiment (even to the point of drawing the universe into your eyes) can achieve a pure art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One character comes close in the form of Juan Garcia Madero. After Lima and Belano leave him and Lupe in the desert, his journal shows him to go on living in impossible conditions for about a month. He too has given up on Visceral Realism, but he ends his journal making bizarre entries involving place names and windows. So with the &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s outside the window?&amp;quot; bit; I think the window is a boundary between the reality of the novel and that of the reader. So much of the book is about how audiences see art, and how ridiculous it is that art aims to be anything when so many people see art differently (i.e. the chapter where each narrator ends a story by saying &amp;quot;Every story that starts as a comedy ends as _______&amp;quot;). The Visceral Realists act in such nonsensical ways that they cannot reason for, as they try to reject reason as a concept. Rejection of reason acknowledges the futility of interpreting art, and opens art to all possible perspectives. The perforation in the window at the end is the result of this opening; the perception of art more and more as like our own reality, excruciating, never quite there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve barely scratched the surface of how complex these themes get in the novel, and I got really excited writing about it so most of this post probably doesn&amp;#39;t make much sense. I&amp;#39;m just excited to hear other people&amp;#39;s perspectives on it, especially since, to me, that&amp;#39;s the main point of the book.&lt;/p&gt;

So I am just a guy who just heard ""about"" the illustrious Homer my entire reading life, and only now took the time to steadily read, and complete, the Iliad in english. Took me about a month or 2, but I consistently worked at it. I'm decently good at reading at this point. If I don't understand something at first, or I notice my attention has flagged, I will take a break and come back to it until I feel I have a grasp and then continue on.

So I've heard all these amazing things about Homer, usually through reading what other great thinkers thought about him (Nietzsche, Goethe specifically) and I have to say I did not enjoy what I read. I never felt entertained. I never even really felt nourished or invigorated. It wasn't even a difficult book. It felt like a flat pastiche of action scenes, with smatterings of emotion pasted on. It didn't feel ""deep,"" which may be another word for exploring subtle psychological dimensions (like war and peace, Ulysses, or Dost.), but I am wondering if that's because epic poetry has a different intent. I am used to reading novels, and feel they give me that gripping feeling.

So I felt different every time I picked up the book, and didn't take my first thought or feeling for granted, but a few ideas consistently stuck with me. I'm not an anime fan, but a lot of the scenes felt like they were in an anime format: with the long speeches of bravado taking place in this mysterious place of stillness, right in the middle of an intense battle scene, where a character explains what they are thinking and feeling in a monologue, and it's all very exaggerated and heavily applied, and then the action is wrapped up very quickly.

Which was great, btw. The vivid descriptions of violence were always fun. And sometimes the language was breathtakingly beautiful...the adjectives that were used were very colorful and bright, and the originality of the language capturing a picturesque scene for a metaphor was something I was constantly struck by. Refreshing is what I'd like to say. And the inclusion of nature into use for grand metaphors may have been a part of this. The refreshing language is what kept me coming back and reading with anticipation each time I re-picked up the book.

Also, the tension and set-up until the release of Achilles on the battlefield was striking. It was  80% build up, with a myriad of heroes rising and falling, and stealing the show for a few hundred lines, and then being eclipsed by yet another larger-than-life hero. And I thought this was beautifully interwoven and put together, with another variation among each interaction, to build the anticipation of ""oh my god, if this dude can do THIS and he's terrified of Achilles, wait until Achilles shows up, what's he going to do?"" 

But the countless names and short biographies of all these actors got super tiresome and tedious, and I didn't bother to try and stick them to memory. Was an audience expected to keep these names in mind? So when someone died it didn't mean much to me.

That's a thing, too. The deaths of people didn't mean anything to me. The tremendous amounts of woe and sorrow that the characters express for eachother is readily on the page, but none of that touched me. Again, unlike my experience when reading a novel where I grow attached to characters and feel something when something happens to them. 

On a side note: I always heard that Patroklus and Achilles were gay lovers. I read the story pretty closely, and I found zero indications of this. In fact, it was quite clearly stated they were brought up young together and were like brothers. Achilles extreme lamentation over his dear friend's death is wholly fitting without the ""gay"" theme. 

So the story I thought had an original, bold story arc. To build up the tension tightly over hundreds of small scenes, to build anticipation for the release of Achilles on the battlefield, who proceeds to dash around the battlefield like a sunbeam, I thought was very cool.

The language was colorful, bright, and refreshing. An adjective never felt misplaced or forced. Excellent stuff.

But the characters and the action in general I developed no emotional attachment for. And if this is the case, why has this story persisted through countless generations as something that is read? And is the emotional attachment actually something I shouldn't have anticipated? Is this just not a feature or goal of epic poetry? Is this where the importance of culture and literature can be discussed?

As for wisdom and intellectual nourishment, I felt it was okay. The hyperbole surrounding the ancient Greeks, (for thousands of years this was an educational text for the upper class Greeks to use, like their bible), and especially Nietzsche speaking about the intellectual vitality and vigor of the pre-socratic Greeks, built up some anticipation in this regard, too. But I just saw it as a warrior culture, with a flat philosophy, not much different than the multiple other warrior cultures from the bronze age. I didn't derive much inspiration from it in this regard.

Fosse’s one of my favorite writers. Hailing from Norway, he’s probably best known for his plays - despite not really catching on in the English-speaking world, he’s supposedly the most performed living playwright - but he’s also written some acclaimed fiction and poetry.

If I had to compare him to any other writer, I’d say he’s arguably closest to Beckett, though I think Fosse’s work has much less humor. He frequently uses a spare style similar to mid to late Beckett, even stripping away punctuation, and of course there’s a certain bleakness both of them share. But Fosse’s more than a less funny imitation of Beckett, he has his own distinct style, and his most recognizable characteristic is probably his repetition. He repeats certain phrases over and over again for artistic effect. If you look around online at reviews, you can quickly see that this is not to everyone’s liking. I will say, however, that even if repetitious quotes but you off of him you should still look into him, as these frequently read much much better in context.

Ex. I’ve seen a few pulled quotes in reviews trashing his novel Melancholy. In most cases, the prose is not as repetitious as it is in those sections, and Fosse is making a certain point by writing like that. (Much of the book is told from the viewpoint of a painter on the verge of a mental breakdown, and this style of narration gives you a more intense look at him than a third person point of view would.)

I think you’ll get a better view of his prose from this article: [https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/06/09/pure-prose/](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2015/06/09/pure-prose/)

I think a lot of his plays are actually available in English, although I haven’t had much luck finding them in libraries and have had to buy them in the past. His best known is probably “Someone is Going to Come,” though my two favorites are “I am the Wind” and “Girl on the Sofa.”

Despite being better known for his plays, however, his novels are what really sold me on him and made him one of my favorite writers, so I’ll discuss his books a bit more.

My favorites are probably the aforementioned Melancholy, Morning and Evening, and The Trilogy.

Melancholy is probably the odd one out there, as its narration isn’t quite like how Fosse writes in nearly every of his books available in English. Like I said, it’s mostly about a painter on the verge of a mental breakdown (and the effects of it afterwards), based on a real-life figure, Lars Hertevig ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars\_Hertervig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Hertervig)). There’s also a coda of sorts available, Melancholy II, about one of Lars’s sisters reflecting on her brother towards the end of her life.

Morning and Evening has two parts. The first, relatively short, depicts the birth of a boy named Johannes, the second, the last day of a man bearing the same name (I thought it was the same person, but I’ve read differing opinions on this online). It is a bit cliché in its set up, but Fosse strips down the narrative an almost mythical, biblical level, and that combined with his depiction of old age makes this an incredible read. This is actually the one that me hooked on his prose.

His Trilogy is a set of three novellas, each building off of one another and continuing the story. In that same biblical, mythical prose, the first one begins with two homeless, expecting lovers, Asle and Alida, who try to find a place for themselves in the world. A few years ago it won one of the most prestigious Scandinavian literature prizes.

(I’d also advise against starting with Aliss at the Fire or Boathouse. They’re both good books, though I found them a bit weaker than those three, as well as a bit more confusing.)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not, hopefully I can convince some people here to check out his work.&lt;/p&gt;

To the extent that DFW is ""postmodern,"" he was really only performing variations on a theme, rather than extending the praxis of it (whatever we mean by ""it"" re: postmodernism), and his most well-known texts actually have intelligible, if dense, plots - they only seem ""experimental"" to folks who haven't dipped seriously into 70s avant garde lit.

I've often seen Wallace compared to Pynchon. This seems both wrong to me, and, more importantly, lazy. Tonally, they couldn't be further apart. The earnestness with which Wallace approaches his subjects (both in his fiction and non-fiction) would be utterly alien to Pynchon the arch-satirist. The ""pet theory"" I allude to in the title is that Wallace &amp; Salinger is actually a much more natural grouping in the annals of American Lit. To wit:

1. Neither depicted a credible adult (heterosexual) love affair in any of their works. (And I'm willing to argue this point.) This a bigger deal than it seems, if you zoom out and analyze their contemporaries. It's a strange, ascetic absence.
2. Both were possessed of a certain self-declared earnestness. I don't have to say much about Wallace in this regard, because he made it explicit in ""E Pluribus Unum"" with the whole New Sincerity bit. But Salinger isn't far off in his embrace of Eastern metaphysics and his (in)famous rejection of fully grown women as sexual partners (see: his fallout w/ Joyce Maynard for not being ""pure"" anymore, after a certain age - she was 20). If you've read Salinger's later work (like ""Seymour: An Introduction"") I think it gives the lie to the idea that Catcher in The Rye is even a bit satirical. We can certainly treat it that way, but I don't think he would. 
3. Ultimately, this insularity and ascetic, sex-shy affect ends up seeming incredibly American to me; a weird psycho-spiritual Puritan vein of American literature. Wallace, of course, wrote a tirade against ""phallic"" male authors like Updike (whom, I should say, I don't have much love for), but didn't exactly indicate a way forward in terms of how male American writers might approach sexuality. This has always seemed to me a perpetually arrested-adolescent aspect of Wallace's work - the clean intellect struggling to overcome the messy paradoxes of the human in sexual love. It's not that he doesn't ever acknowledge sexuality as a driving force, but he does it in the almost antiseptic way of...dare I say...a Reddit comment. To this I would attribute much of his popularity. I sort of wonder what Wallace thought of Marguerite Duras.

About to be medical student (physical therapist) here, and I would just like to give my insights (perhaps, more appropriately, opinions) on incest as a theme in literature. My course may be unrelated, but I am very fond of the literary works from around the world, so I would therefore be pleased to hear from anyone of you in the comments regarding the matter of this post.

Now, perhaps many of us know this, but incestuous themes existed in literature ever since the beginning of time. One may recall the tragedy *Oedipus Rex* by Sophocles, in which it centered on Oedipus, the main character unknowingly having an incestuous relationship with his mother, Jocasta (among other plots within the play), therefore resulting in a tragic end for both of them. 

Modern times gave rise to various criticisms regarding the incest plots of literary works. In the field of religion, the ""Adam and Eve"" story has even been used as a way to explain what I would personally call a ""trend"" in various literary works, the ""trend"" being incest. To mention a few works out of the many, *The Cement Garden* by Ian McEwan, *Ada* by Vladimir Nabokov are ones that clearly depicts the story of an incestuous relationship. In fact, even Franz Kafka's *The Metamorphosis* still remains a popular topic of debate whether the main character, Gregor Samsa has incestuous desires for his sister, Grete, despite critics arguing that this is more on his masochistic fantasies.

Of course, another insight that may be linked to this is the theories of Sigmund Freud, the very person who invented the term *Oedipus Complex,* no less. I would assume that readers already know about that term, so forgive me for not elaborating more on this. I am no expert in the field of psychology (not even literature, which is why I hope to gain more knowledge here) so please allow me to refrain from going into detail about psychology.

So, what I would like to hear from you dear readers are your thoughts on this matter: Can one view the recurring incest theme in literary works as a ""nod of acceptance"" towards that taboo? Or is it simply, on the surface, a superficial way to weave a desirable plot? 

To conclude, here are my thoughts on this matter. Incest in literature is, to me in my own words, a way to ""make the forbidden fruit appealing"", and the very epitome of ""romanticizing tragedy"", as most literary works involving incest end as such.

It's my first post here, so again, I would appreciate it if I can hear from any of you. Have a nice day.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi!

Sorry, I just need to rant and am wondering what everyone else thinks. 

I'm a female writer and an active member of the so-called literary community on twitter, and lately I've been troubled by the attitudes on there toward other books. Most writers are socially progressive, which, don't get me wrong, is great, but sometimes I think they take it too far. Lots of journal submission guidelines now warn submitters against submitting stories that contain sexual abuse, misogyny, fat-shaming, racism, and just about any other kind of prejudice, which sounds good in theory, but in reality is kind of troubling. I work for a journal myself, and I routinely reject stories where it's evident the author is sexist (or at least has no understanding of how women actually think or act), but I would never reject a story simply because a character is sexist. Other journals are definitely doing this, though (as evidenced by editors' tweets and interviews), and it makes me fear we are on a path toward boring and preachy literature that deals in moral absolutism--if a character has even one bad quality, he cannot be seen as good or forgivable. People are already beginning to look at older literature through this lens. I just unfollowed another writer on twitter for tweeting a picture of Flannery O'Connor's A Good Man is Hard to Find with the caption ""problematic fave."" Seriously? Because O'Connor wrote racist characters to portray racism in the south, she's now problematic? I see this kind of thing over and over again: suddenly it's bad to read Hemingway because he wasn't some morally upstanding citizen, Lolita is clearly a book endorsing pedophilia because it privileges the pedophile's voice over the victim's, and it's cool to reject any and all books written by men. 

These kinds of attitudes are everywhere in the literary world, from twitter to essays on Lit Hub and Electric Literature to my own MFA classes, and I'm tired of it. Do I think diversity in publishing is important? Absolutely. Do I think sexist/racist/etc literature should be suppressed? Yeah, as long as we're distinguishing between prejudiced authors and prejudiced characters. Do I think recognizing problematic aspects of already-existing literature is valuable? Sure, but there's a huge difference between recognition and rejection. Just wondering when people will figure that out.

Edit: realize I made it sound like I reject people just because I assume they're sexist, which isn't true. I think there's a major difference between a story that contains sexism and a story that is blatantly sexist without any reason. If a story contains sexism (or any kind of prejudice) that doesn't somehow serve the story, either in character development, theme, setting, etc, then it generally ruins the story, or at least bogs it down with unnecessary detail that leaves me scratching my head and wondering why the author decided to include those details. Hopefully that makes sense? I also get a lot of female characters that are poorly written stereotypes, and these always come from men. 

Bottom line: I have no way of intuiting a writer's belief system. I just read stories, and they're either good or not, and part of what makes a story bad is extraneous detail and characters that aren't fully fleshed out.

I am sharing what I understood from my first reading of the play, do pitch in and share your ideas to help understand it better.

Horatio Alger’s novels in Gilded Age America illustrate the nation's most popular and enduring myth– the American Dream; as Algeresque heroes move from rags to respectability through pluck and luck.

However, in this play American myth clashes with American reality; there is a gaping discrepancy between the protagonist Willy Loman’s ideals and his life. 

Willy a salesman for the Wagner Company believes he is “vital in New England,” and is therefore baffled by the failure of his ‘American Dream.’ 

Miller uses the recurring flute music as an expressionist device and deploys the ""Flashback Narrative / Dream Technique” to help us understand how Willy struggles between illusion and reality and has trouble defining and distinguishing the past from the present.

Willy preaches clean living, friendliness, sportsmanship and honesty but ingrains the wrong idea in Biff’s head that a person can do anything as long as they are popular. Hence, Biff develops an addiction to stealing and introduces the play’s theft motif. 

Biff catches Willy red handed gifting stockings to his mistress and henceforth stockings become a symbol of Willy’s infidelity. 

Willy favours Biff over his other son Happy, though Biff at 34 years is still doing menial work and Happy is relatively successful in his job. However, Willy’s favouritism seems to have had a detrimental effect on Happy who is an unscrupulous playboy.

Linda, Willy's wife dotes on him though she knows that Willy is suicidal and difficult to deal with. Howard unfeelingly fires Willy after 35 years of service with the parting shot “Business is business”. 

Willy feels betrayed by the myths and ethics of his society and responds, “You can't eat the orange and throw the peel away - a man is not a piece of fruit.” Between his financial struggles and inability to come to terms with reality, Willy commits suicide.

Biff realizes that his father futilely pursued the “wrong” dream, as Willy derived his sense of identity from physical labour, “A man who can’t handle tools is not a man.” Conversely, Happy supports Willy’s choices, “It's the only dream you can have - to come out number-one man”. 

Linda’s direct cry to human dignity resonates at Willy’s sparsely attended funeral, “He's not to be allowed to fall in his grave like an old dog. Attention, attention must finally be paid to such a person.”  

Willy does not experience tragic recognition (Anagnorisis) before his death; there is no increase in self-knowledge and awareness. So, though his fate engenders tragic feelings he cannot aspire to the status of a true tragic hero.

From his first page Marquez admits his incredibly audacious aim: to create a new and complete mythology centered in Latin America and denying the preeminent influence of Western culture. 

Readers soon find out that the story takes place in the 20th century. By that time Latin America had already been colonized by the Spanish for centuries. The name Buendia itself is a portmanteau of the Spanish phrase ""Good day."" It would be incorrect to claim that these villagers are simply isolated native Americans who have yet to experience colonization. We learn later that they are outcasts from another village that our patriarch Jose Arcadio Buendia exiles himself from to escape the ghost of a man he murdered.

""Arcadio"" is a specific reference to the Greek region of Arcadia. From the wiki: ""It is situated in the central and eastern part of the Peloponnese peninsula. It takes its name from the mythological figure Arcas. In Greek mythology, it was the home of the god Pan. In European Renaissance arts, Arcadia was celebrated as an unspoiled, harmonious wilderness.""

Why then does he claim that his villagers lacked words? Marquez is being intentionally deceptive with his descriptions of time. In order for Macondo to exist independently he must divorce it from the times and customs of the past. It is a town before language and thus before writing. What we learn about the village in those times is necessarily a product of oral tradition not scholarly writing. He is implicitly aligning himself with Homeric epics and other pre-christian philosophies.

The term ""prehistoric eggs"" brings to mind some antediluvian era filled with creatures of the deep.

Marquez is attempting something that outwardly accepts all the Spanish and greater Western European traditional while simultaneously casting it aside. 

This is a new myth, with new words. 

Initially Macondo can be considered a kind of Eden. Jose Arcadio Buendia and his Wife/Cousin Ursula would obviously fill the role of Adam and Eve. Marquez does not shy away from the obvious implications of biblical incest and makes it expressly apparent. Their love is the original sin their Eden is a place of refuge but to apply a rigidly Christian understanding to this myth would be hopelessly reductive. In Macondo, there is no God. Even when churches are built and the strictly Catholic Fernanda takes control of the home there is never any indication that the blood members of the Buendia family are religious at all. They accept the unwritten myths, the strange prophecies, and contradictory philosophies without question. By the end of his life Jose Arcadio Buendia is more convinced of man's complete isolation. 

Instead Marquez offers a far more chaotic sense of spirituality. Characters are given strange omens, plagues of insomnia come and go, butterflies follow men, cursed indelible ash marks victims of fate, ghosts speak freely to the living, men become invisible unexpectedly.  He stops short of creating any kind of rule or structure. In Latin America the world and its symbols are self-creating.

The central premise, of a ""postcolonial witch doctor"" who cures illnesses through essentially storytelling, calls into question the line between truth and fiction. In a world where objectivity is forced onto the populace by a totalitarian regime, shaping reality through storytelling is, in a way, a form of resistance. 

The novel is also a hilarious satire. There were several moments when I actually laughed out loud. The author translates his own work, so it feels much more lively and fluid than a lot of translations, though it still feels like there might be some wordplay (especially with character names) which is lost if you don't know Gĩkũyũ. 

The narrative is driven by a cast of unique and interesting characters, which is something I miss. As a kid I read a lot more genre fiction, and I feel like a lot of literary fiction is so focused on ideas that characterization isn't focused on as much.

I understand that the so-called heros journey has always been important to literature, but in my opinion, our writing culture has only grown more obsessed with it in recent decades, rather than less. A good example I always use in my head  is to compare a classic writer like Hemingway, to someone more recent like Stephen King. Obviously, everyone *says* that Hemingways books have a plot, but in comparison to the modern idea of what a plot is, like in a King book, they almost appear to have none. Nothing weird comes to town in most Hemingway books. No crime needs to be solved. No certain object needs to be found. The dialogue often doesn't even really seem to go anywhere --- it just sort of sounds beautiful. I'm sure such writers are out there these days, still, but for the most part, every time I open a new book, i just tend to find the sons and daughters of damn Stephen King, writing with only some epic quest in mind -- never just simply exploring a place, like you could say Hemingway did in *The Green Hills of AFrica.* (which I have read 15 times but still don't quite know the 'holy plot' of).

I have been of the opinion for some years, in fact, that the plot obsession is one big reason that many fine artists have abandoned the literary form (almost without even considering it) for other mediums. In every other medium (even films) there is a place for plotlessness, for meandering, for surrealism and taking it easy.  Songs and paintings could care less for a plot.

Only the novel, and specifically the modern novel, especially in a post Stephen King and post JK Rowling world, is so obsessed with getting one particular character from point A to point B. I look at it almost like a cancer that has infected the medium. In my opinion, many artists don't even consider writing a novel, not because they have nothing to express--but rather because thre is this insidious idea that one needs some grandiose plot or idea, in order to start one. In other words, the idea of expression is no longer rally apart of the ballgame, in the average persons head of ""What is a novel?"".

Expression has been traded away. Just get your character from point A to point B, occasionally describe some background settings, talk about a pretty fire burning, have your character look at it -- but there's no need to really express anything beyond that. It is more important that he manages to get the final object of your video game plot. It is more important that ""Harry"" ultimately defeats ""Voldemort"". And this happens over and over again, in novel after novel.

Again, maybe I'm mistaken and just imagining all of this, but its an idea I have had for some years. I'm not saying that plot is always bad. I just think its kind of stupid sometimes, and its sad to me, how convinced people are, that this is all there is to writing, when there is really much more. Everyone knows that books are not really popular today--especially in comparison to music. Most people just write this off as a result of books being ""harder"" or something like that. TOo quiet.

IN my opinion, its really just because books no longer *explore anything* like music does all the time. Music explores ideas of beauty, of a carefree afternoon, drinking, dancing, just relaxing in the woods,silliness, ponderous conversations, etc. A lot of stuff like this --simple day to day stuff-- never gets a chance to appear in novels, beecause Lord almighty, the modern writer can't find a way to connect it to his insufferable f'n plot and his never ending need for 'conflict'. There is a literal sense of actual fear attached to not keeping up with a plot as one writes now, i feel. Don't maintain a strict and clear line of action, conflict, and plot? Someone in 2018 world may very well just accuse you of not even writing a real book at all. Hemingway could not have written what he wrote then, in our time. He would have been told his characters were meandering. Wasn't there some mystical obejct everyone had to find at the end of the War, Ernie? What were you doing in Africa? Certainly, ERnie, you were there for a strict reason -- no one has ever done anything to merely hang around and see things.  Or have they? Damn them if they have. 

I sometimes think the obsession our modern society has with the idea of ""being productive"" also is to blame for this plot cancer. People have become afraid to write a book of characters who don't do anything important. We must all be productive ALL THE TIME! 

Am I all alone in thinking this or what? Excuse me if i sound like a prick. I don't know how else to express myself, I guess. I have, after all, come of age in a culture that has relentlessly stressed to me, that all the world is, is point A to point B. Hemingway and other writers like him was an anomaly here.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forgive me if I am horribly mistaken -- but am i the only one who thinks that novels of today seem very different from the old novels, and that a lot of that difference has to do with a plot obsession?&lt;/p&gt;

Everyone knows that books are not really popular today--especially in comparison to music. Most people just write this off as a result of books being &amp;quot;harder&amp;quot; or something like that. TOo quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IN my opinion, its really just because books no longer &lt;em&gt;explore anything&lt;/em&gt; like music does all the time. Music explores ideas of beauty, of a carefree afternoon, drinking, dancing, just relaxing in the woods,silliness, ponderous conversations, etc. A lot of stuff like this --simple day to day stuff-- never gets a chance to appear in novels, beecause Lord almighty, the modern writer can&amp;#39;t find a way to connect it to his insufferable f&amp;#39;n plot and his never ending need for &amp;#39;conflict&amp;#39;. There is a literal sense of actual fear attached to not keeping up with a plot as one writes now, i feel. Don&amp;#39;t maintain a strict and clear line of action, conflict, and plot? Someone in 2018 world may very well just accuse you of not even writing a real book at all. Hemingway could not have written what he wrote then, in our time. He would have been told his characters were meandering. Wasn&amp;#39;t there some mystical obejct everyone had to find at the end of the War, Ernie? What were you doing in Africa? Certainly, ERnie, you were there for a strict reason -- no one has ever done anything to merely hang around and see things.  Or have they? Damn them if they have. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sometimes think the obsession our modern society has with the idea of &amp;quot;being productive&amp;quot; also is to blame for this plot cancer. People have become afraid to write a book of characters who don&amp;#39;t do anything important. We must all be productive ALL THE TIME! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I all alone in thinking this or what? Excuse me if i sound like a prick. I don&amp;#39;t know how else to express myself, I guess. I have, after all, come of age in a culture that has relentlessly stressed to me, that all the world is, is point A to point B. Hemingway and other writers like him was an anomaly here.&lt;/p&gt;

Rudyard Kipling was one of the most popular writers in the British Empire, however his reputation stirred up controversy when the empire receded.

So did the sun set not only on the British Empire but on Kipling too? 

George Orwell calls Kipling ""a jingo imperialist"", who was ""morally insensitive and aesthetically disgusting"". Was he right?

I read two of his ballads ‘Mandalay’ and ‘Gunga Din’ set during the heydays of the British Empire. I have re-capped them so as to determine the answer. Let me know what you think.

Kipling’s literary ballad ‘Mandalay’ illustrates the nostalgia and longing of a soldier of the British Empire for Asia's exoticism, through vivid and sensuous imagery. 

The soldier recalls Burma as the land of the “Great Gawd Budd” and “old Moulmein Pagoda,” where the wind rustles through the palm trees. One can hear the ""tinkly temple-bells,"" watch the “flyin'-fishes play” and smell the “spicy garlic smells.”      

The soldier remembers the first kiss he shared with Burmese beauty Supi-yaw-lat and treasures his summer idyll spent with her watching the “steamers an' the hathis pilin' teak.”    

The soldier yearns for warmer climes and denounces London as a place with “gritty pavin'-stones” where the “blasted English drizzle wakes the fever in my bones”. 

The soldier despises the “beefy faces” of English housemaids and longs to escape the colourlessness and restraint of Western life. The soldier hopes to be posted “somewhere east of Suez” where he can be reunited with “a neater, sweeter maiden in a cleaner, greener land!  

However, despite the haunting refrain, “On the road to Mandalay” and the evocative ballad rhythms; I have to infer that Kipling’s vision is problematic as he idealizes the imperialist experience.

In reality, Burma was a colonial holding where racism was rampant, and the British were in Burma to pilfer and oppress the natives.

The second literary ballad ‘Gunga Din’ reveals the racial and ethnic divisions between British soldiers and their native servants in colonial India.

The poem is written in the heroic rhyme scheme of AABCCB and the Tommy dialect belongs to   a cockney British soldier, Thomas Atkins. 

The lowly regimental ""bhishti"" Gunga Din is portrayed as a stereotypical Indian manservant, who should be content to serve those ""better"" than him.

Din derided as a “limping lump o' brick-dust” saves the soldier in the line of fire and carries him to a “dooli.” Din subsequently dies from a gunshot himself, but the wounded soldier is touched by Din’s   dying words, “I 'ope you liked your drink.”

The British soldier comes to regard the native bhisthi not just as a water carrier; but as a brave and courageous man, “You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din!” He remarks that despite Din’s dirty hide he was white, clear white, inside. 	

The poem concludes with the soldier’s encomium, “Tho' I've belted you and flayed you / By the livin' Gawd that made you /You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din!”

Thus, courage and selflessness determine who the better man is in Kipling’s world. 

However, despite the admirable world view, I have to again infer that Kipling’s vision is problematic as he idealizes the imperialist experience. 

In reality, the treatment of Din shows the casual racism and brutality of Kipling’s heroes, the British soldiers. 

In conclusion, Kipling’s works do not resonate with the present political and social climate, so he does appear ‘morally insensitive’.

I need some assistance trying to understand Krasznahorkai's philosophy before his shift to Seibo. I've read Satantango, Melancholy, and War&amp;War. 

**SPOILERS FOR WAR&amp;WAR BELOW:** 

Background: Some months back, I watched Bela Tarr's magnificent film: The Turin Horse. Now, for those of you that have seen the movie, there is a particular monologue by the character Bernhard (http://kathiesmith.blogspot.com/2012/03/turin-horse-script.html) that I was never able to wrap my head around. 

At the time, I wasn't sure I completely understood it, and despite loving the movie, I just forgot about it. Now lo and behold, as I was reading Krasznahorkai's War and War, I stumble on it again (though perhaps this is the original...) and I still couldn't completely grasp it despite having the context of the entire book. The monologue can be found here: http://www.krasznahorkai.hu/books_WarAndWar_III.html

I would really like some help. When Korin says: *""they've ruined everything they've managed to get their hands on, and by waging an endless, treacherous war of attrition they have managed to get their hands on everything, ruined everything...""*

**Who exactly is/are ""they?""**
Is it humanity? A greater force? I'd speculate it's the former because he compares ""they"" to the 'great and noble.'  For the ""great and noble"" the book seems to imply that it may be individuals, such as the four men of the manuscript or the great creators of the the world's fine architectures, who have faith in greater principles/higher power (or if Melancholy is anything to go by, the possibility of change itself). In other word, your Valuskas or perhaps even the hopeless inhabitants from Satantango. Ultimately, my reading led me to conclude that ""they"" are probably a contrast; in other words, those who seek to destroy other's faith; who seek to reduce everything to the mind such as Mastemann. 

Korin later says, *""...thereby control everything today, and there is not a nook or cranny in which you could hide anything from them, everything being theirs, said Korin at his accustomed speed, theirs is everything that may be possessed, and the decisive proportion of even those things that can't, because heaven is theirs, and every dream, every moment of silence in nature, and, in the popular saying, immortality too is theirs - only the most common and vulgar of immortalities of course.""*

Which seems to suggest that ""they"" have reduced all things - the tangible and those that stem from belief into mere objects devoid of any meaning. In other words, the struggle from Melancholy - where the inherent clash of individuals to create meaning in the object separate from the object itself - has come to an end. The logic which ""they"" utilize leads to the conclusion that Nothing has meaning - that good and bad cease. And the 'good and noble' accepted the logic without realizing the implication, which is what led to our destruction.

I have no idea whether or not I'm way off the mark or if I'm on the right path. If anyone is familiar with either Tarr's or Krasznahorkai's works could please help explain, I'd be very interested. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

I accepted my friend’s challenge to read and understand Eliot’s obscure poem ‘The Waste Land’. It was hard work initially with so many multiple allusions but I persevered and in the process learnt many new ideas.

I thought I would summarize my understanding of this poem incomplete though it is and share it so all of you can pitch in and help understand it better and maybe even encourage others to give the poem a try!

Eliot’s ‘The Waste Land’ as a title and symbol refers to the idea of a dry and sterile wasteland as a metaphor for a Europe devastated by war, and desperate for spiritual replenishment; but depleted of the cultural tools necessary for renewal.

Eliot uses the ‘Mythical method’ and the past as a trope to deploy Pagan and Christian myths from Frazer’s ‘The Golden Bough.’ Eliot also draws on the Fisher King from the Grail Legend in Weston's ‘From Ritual to Romance. The wounded Fisher King’s disease causes the wasteland, a fallen world in need of redemption; that is the central image of the poem.
 
The poem’s epigraph introduces the ancient prophetess Sibyl of Cumae who guided Aeneas through Hades. The image of Hades combined with her utterance of a death wish introduces death as the poem’s leitmotif.

Eliot employs the poetic technique of ‘Montage-Imagism,’ ""heap of broken images"" to symbolically represent the themes of barrenness, decay and death. Eliot also employs ‘Heteroglossia’ to present multiple voices in quick succession to convey the motif of moral degeneration.

The blind hermaphroditic prophet Tiresias’s dual voices (masculine and feminine) act as a guide through the poem. The ""visionary"" Tiresias provides an insight into people, places and events and what Tiresias “sees” is in fact the substance of the poem.

The first section, “THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD:” references the burial service in the Anglican Church. “April is the cruellest month” as the celebration of spring as a time of natural renewal is not mirrored in human souls.

The imagery of dryness in the wasteland, “dry stone no sound of water” is a central motif that defines the spiritual and social aridity of the time.

The second section, “A GAME OF CHESS:” explores the theme of sexual aridity in the social world of the wasteland, as a wealthy couple go through the motions of a depleted relationship; their sexual malaise symbolized by the mechanics of a chess game.
	
Two cockney women in an East-side pub discuss Lil’s barren sexuality and further the theme. The barman’s call for closing, “HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME” is seemingly an advent call for change.

The third section, “THE FIRE SERMON:” refers to Buddha’s sermon against the fires of lust and explores the connection between sexuality and religion. 

Tiresias in his androgynous mode reflects on both the male and female aspects of the modern-day affair, between a seedy clerk who engages a tired typist in a sexual liaison that she neither desires nor resists. At the completion of the meaningless, mechanical coupling, the typist is “glad its over.”

The fourth section, “DEATH BY WATER:” links water with death in the brief elegiac lyrics to Phlebas, the drowned Phoenician sailor. Phlebas belongs to an extinct race, but the physical reality of death and inevitable decay is universal and relevant even today.

The final section, “WHAT THE THUNDER SAID:” depicts the world as a wasteland awaiting redemption. A “damp gust” brings rain and Prajapati, God of Thunder utters ""Da"" which is interpreted variously by the residents of Triloka (three worlds from Hindu mythology)

Men, the residents of Martyalok (earth) interpret “Da” as ""Datta"" which means ""give"" as they are naturally avaricious hoarders who would benefit from giving in charity.

Asuras, the residents of Narkalok (hell) interpret “Da” as “Dayadhvam” which means “be merciful” as they are naturally cruel and would benefit if their anger was tempered by mercy.

Celestials, the residents of Swargalok (heaven) interpret “Da” as “Damyata” which means “restrain yourself” as they are lotus eaters who would benefit if their sensual pleasures were tempered by restraint.

The rain combined with the profoundly spiritual moment of communication between men and God suggests new beginnings, a washing away of sin, and hope for the return of spirituality to modern life.

The poem ends with an Upanishadic ‘Shanti Mantra,’ “Shantih shantih shantih,"" uttered thrice so as to calm and remove obstacles in three realms and bless humanity with ‘The peace which passeth all understanding.’

I first read “The Old Man and the Sea” at college. I find it takes on more profound meaning every time I re-read it. This is my latest take on the novella.

Hemingway’s “The Old Man and the Sea”, is an epic account of man’s struggle against the forces of nature. It portrays the contest between power and patience in an elemental fight wherein patience triumphs eventually.

The first paragraph emphasizes Santiago's apparent lack of material success, but we learn later that he possesses ample spiritual success. This triumph of indefatigable spirit over exhaustible material resources is an important theme of the novella.

Hemingway’s descriptive degradation of Santiago continues with details of his old, worn body, however ""Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated"". 

Santiago's eye color foreshadows Hemingway's increasingly explicit likening of Santiago to the sea, suggesting an analogy between Santiago's indomitable spirit and the sea's boundless strength. Therefore, the title “The Old Man and the Sea” is fitting and justified.

Santiago had gone eighty four days now without taking a fish, hence, his young apprentice Manolin has been forbidden by his parents to sail with the old man. 

Manolin has been ordered to fish with more successful fishermen as ""the old man was now and definitely salao, which is the worst form of unlucky"". This sentence proclaims one of the novella's themes, the heroic struggle against unchangeable fate. 

Manolin was however dedicated to the old man, ""The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him"". Despite the clear hierarchy of this teacher/student relationship, Santiago stresses his equality with the boy. When Manolin asks to buy the old man a beer, he replies, ""Why not? ... Between fisherman"".

Manolin discusses American baseball with Santiago; the valorizing references to the “great DiMaggio” and his struggle to play with a bone spur in his heel are a transparent reference to another heroic archetype, Achilles. 

On the eighty fifth day, Santiago sets out alone, taking his skiff far onto the Gulf Stream, confident that his unlucky streak is near its end.  When out at sea, he longs for company; “No one should be alone in their old age” 

Santiago, a true Code Hero knows that as he ages, he is getting closer to death every day. 

Ironically, the Code Hero can also be afraid of the dark, as it symbolizes the void/ nothingness “Nada” that comes with death.

The phrase, “Hemingway Code Hero” originated with scholar Philip Young. Here, ""Code"" means a set of rules or guidelines for conduct which dictate that the hero act honorably in the midst of what will be a losing battle. 

The phrase ""Grace under Pressure"" is used to describe the conduct of the Code Hero. 

Hemingway portrays Santiago as a true Code Hero who displays immense grace while under the pressure of catching his adversary, the marlin.

On his return journey Santiago armed with only a short knife, fights and kills four man-eating sharks that bombard him at night. 

Finally, Santiago reaches the shore before dawn with the fish’s skeleton still attached to his boat. 

A worried Manolin cries upon finding the old man safe asleep and when he wakes, they promise to fish together once again. 

Santiago's childlike dream of playful lions (symbols of male strength and virility) imply the coming of Santiago's second youth.

Hemingway writes, ""He (Santiago) was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility”. Hemingway qualifies that humility was “not disgraceful” and “it carried no loss of true pride”. Thus, humility and the acceptance of obligation are in fact marks of manhood. 

The novella portrays the Hemingway Code Hero to his fullest potential as Santiago does not forsake the principle of courage but says, “A man may be destroyed but not defeated.”

&lt;p&gt;Hemingway portrays Santiago as a true Code Hero who displays immense grace while under the pressure of catching his adversary, the marlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On his return journey Santiago armed with only a short knife, fights and kills four man-eating sharks that bombard him at night. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Santiago reaches the shore before dawn with the fish’s skeleton still attached to his boat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A worried Manolin cries upon finding the old man safe asleep and when he wakes, they promise to fish together once again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santiago&amp;#39;s childlike dream of playful lions (symbols of male strength and virility) imply the coming of Santiago&amp;#39;s second youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hemingway writes, &amp;quot;He (Santiago) was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility”. Hemingway qualifies that humility was “not disgraceful” and “it carried no loss of true pride”. Thus, humility and the acceptance of obligation are in fact marks of manhood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The novella portrays the Hemingway Code Hero to his fullest potential as Santiago does not forsake the principle of courage but says, “A man may be destroyed but not defeated.”&lt;/p&gt;

Ten years from now, I expect to see some new additions to the pool of acceptable texts, maybe even some more modern pieces on college reading lists. Considering that many books that are now considered classics might one have been dismissed as trite, silly things, particularly early novels, before fiction became acceptable; I know Moby Dick in particular was torn apart by critics when it was released. Keeping that in mind, what sort of books that are currently seen as fads or maybe even just poplit, might eventually be taught in universities or considered classics?

I, personally, hope to see fantasy and science fiction come more into the light, and children's books as well. Phillip Pullman's *His Dark Materials* trilogy has a lot of interesting ideas, and I've always been a fan of mature sounding child narrators giving their perspective on adult events. Given that *Huck Finn* was often considered children's lit, but is now often studied, I don't think it's out of the realm of imagination to consider that the YA and Juvenile genres might become more mainstream.  J.R.R. Tolkien's works are currently making the crossover, and many other fantasy books have begun to be more acceptable works of study as well, which I'm quite excited to see, as a lover of fantasy.

Obviously as a college student, I enjoyed a lot of YA novels, so I do wonder how popular series, like Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, the Hunger Games, and Ender's Game will stand the test of time. (Additionally, how does the cinematization of these series affect public perception of their worth?)

Currently, one of the modern books I've read that I think is most likely to make a lasting impression is Barbara Kingsolver's *Poisonwood Bible.* The prose is gorgeous to read, the characters are both archetypal and defy definition, and there seems to be a never ending well of thematic ideas and statements to be drawn from. I've written papers on the novel, but considering that I'm still in an undergraduate program, that doesn't say much.

In the vein of this, if newer books will eventually be deemed ""literature"", is the field of literature on a trajectory of infinite expansion? Now that the technology exists to preserve a work and the literature on it almost perpetually, content and analysis can only increase, especially if there's little to no culling of the ""list"" of what can be considered true literature. So far, there are few books that are removed from that list once they receive the title. Books fall out of favor, but very rarely are they deemed to be ""trash"" or unworthy once scholars and academics begin to analyze them. It almost seems that the concept of a work's literary worth is created once analysis takes place.

I know an author's reputation can be tarnished, and their work may lose popularity, but does that necessarily negate something's status as a work to be remembered? I'm curious to hear others' ideas on this topic.

TL;DR

The pool of literature is rather fickle, and many books weren't considered classics until long after their publication.

Poisonwood Bible is a modern piece that shares a lot of the markers of good literature. What current works will endure the test of time and end up being recognized as excellent works of literature?

If there were two things I could say I'd say it's pretentious and I love it. 

Cortazar manages to hit perfect measures of obscurantist philosophizing and self-deprecating humor. It's not that Cortazar forgets, even for a moment, that his hero Horacio Oliveira is unbearably vague, intellectually dishonest and self-aggrandizing. His companions constantly berate him, they say all he does is throw words around. The women especially La Maga, Pola, and Talita are often exasperated by his useless tangents. Cortazar understands that Oliveira's maze of thoughts is a kind of...but his protagonist hates psychoanalysis. In fact, there's a lot of ways of thinking that Oliveira seems to hate, eleatic thinking, oneiromancy, Catholicism, platonism, all manner of fortune telling... It doesn't seem like Oliveira is interested in any type of cohesiveness or consistency. At times he's convinced the mysteries of the universe are all tied up in a gourd full of *mate* and his entire agonistic impulse is tied up in his distaste for *cafe con leche*. 

If you're ever beginning to feel like this might be a waste of time, Cortazar agrees. The introduction says the last 99 chapters in his novel are expendable and can be skipped ""with a clean conscience."" A joke or challenge? His tone makes it impossible to tell. So he forces you to bounce around the book like you would your memories in some predetermined pattern, he skips a chapter, and eventually he traps you in a recursive loop. 

The result is a work of appalling originality something that asks you to join along in its own self-destruction and to go along, past the end, to the heaven square in Hopscotch, the kibbutz of desire, the Yggdrasil of blah blah blah blah. 

TLDR: It's good. 

P.S. The novel is meant to be played like any game but to what end? Cortazar gives us two ways to read the text, neither of them is satisfying, the way of the ""female-reader"" which consists of reading chapters 1-56 in order and the way of the ""accomplice reader"" which consists of hopping around starting from 73 and hitting every chapter at least once. The latter has been tragically simplified as the ""male-reader"" by critics who don't share Cortazar's disdain for simple binaries. There is a third way, the way in which the reader hops around as they see fit organizing the book into their own specific order (this is what I would argue constitutes a male reading.) 

If the book's structure ultimately qualifies as a gimmick similar to shuffling a deck of cards and handing it to the reader to place back into order then it is at the very least an honest attempt to add layers of deception, illusion, and imagination to our spiritual ennui. If Oliveira eventually ends like Hamlet, wondering why he shouldn't just kill himself as he does at the window of the asylum, he does it dazzlingly with renewed energy, magic, and absurdity.

From Humboldt's Gift, a little peacocking to start things off...

""The Boeing tore off through shawls of cloud, the hurtling moment of risk and death ended with a musical Bing! and we entered the peace and light above. My head lay back on the bib and bosom of the seat and when the Jack Daniel’s came I strained it through my irregular multicolored teeth, curling my forefinger over the top of the glass to hold back the big perforated ice cubes--they always put in too many. The thread of whisky burned pleasantly in the gullet and then my stomach, like the sun outside, began to glow, and the delight of freedom also began to expand within me… 

Once in a while, I get shocked into upper wakefulness, I turn a corner, see the ocean, and my heart tips over with happiness--it feels so free! Then I have the idea that, as well as beholding, I can also be beheld from yonder and am not a discrete object but incorporated with the rest, with universal sapphire, purplish blue. For what is this sea, this atmosphere, doing within the eight-inch diameter of your skull? (I say nothing of the sun and the galaxy which are also there.) At the center of the beholder there must be space for the whole, and this nothing-space is not an empty nothing but a nothing reserved for everything. You can feel this nothing-everything capacity with ecstasy and this was what I actually felt in the jet. Sipping whisky, feeling the radiant heat that rose inside, I experienced a bliss that I knew perfectly well was not mad.""

From Herzog, where he visits his deceased father's house:

""After Howard Street he was in the city proper and knew his way. Leaving the Expressway at Montrose, he turned east and drove to his late father's house, a small two-story brick building, one of a row built from a single blueprint-the pitched roof, the cement staircase inset on the right side, the window boxes the length of the front-room windows, the lawn a fat mound of grass between the sidewalk and the foundation; along the curb, elms and those shabby cottonwoods with blackened, dusty, wrinkled bark, and leaves that turned very tough by midsummer. There were also certain flowers, peculiar to Chicago, crude, waxy things like red and purple crayon bits, in a special class of false-looking natural objects. These foolish plants touched Herzog because they were so graceless, so corny. He was reminded of his father's devotion to his garden, when old Herzog became a property owner toward the end of his life-how he squirted his flowers at evening with the hose and how rapt he looked, his lips quietly pleased and his straight nose relishing the odor of the soil. To right and left, as Herzog emerged from the rented hard-top, the sprinklers turned and danced, scattering bright drops, fizzing out iridescent veils. And this was the house in which Father Herzog had died a few years ago, on a summer night, sitting up in bed suddenly, saying, ""Ich shtarb!""

And then he died, and that vivid blood of his turned to soil, in all the shrunken passages of his body.

And then the body, too-ah, God!- wastes away; and leaves its bones, and even the bones at last wear away and crumble to dust in that shallow place of deposit. And thus humanized, this planet in its galaxy of stars and worlds goes from void to void, infinitesimal, aching with its unrelated significance.

Unrelated?

Herzog, with one of his Jewish shrugs, whispered, ""Nu, maile...

Be that as it may. In any case, here was his late father's house in which the widow lived, Moses' very ancient stepmother, quite alone in this small museum of the Herzogs...""

I'm not sure how many people are familiar with the concept of what is sometimes called Literary Darwinism, but the general idea is to bring the study of literature into alignment with evolutionary science, making particular use of evolutionary psychology. What these scholars would argue is that the creation and enjoyment of literature seems to be a universal human trait that must be the result of some useful adaptation, and is therefore best understood by through reference to evolutionary science rather than more familiar strategies of the humanities. In the words of Joseph Carroll, ""**Adaptationist literary scholars are convinced that through adaptationist thinking they can more adequately understand what literature is, what its functions are, and how it works, - what it represents, what causes people to produce it and consume it and why it takes the form it does**"". This often takes the form of looking at the way stories reinforce mate selection strategies and etc.

As a literary scholar, this kind of interdisciplinary thinking is really interesting to me, but I'm not without my suspicions. Some of these Darwinian critics stress that the only legitimate way to look at literature, or art in general, is through evolutionary terms, which is clearly ridiculous. But there are other concerns. Jonathan Kramnick, a professor at Rutgers, has pointed to the fact that evolutionary psychology is itself a controversial area of study: ""**According to the influential critique of Steven Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, sociobiology was merely an extreme example of a pervasive mistake within evolutionary biology itself: the parceling of an organism into discrete traits, each of which could be identified as an adaptation selected for its fitness...Selection could occur without adaptation, and adaptation without selection. There mere presence of a trait was therefore not evidence of utility, nor was utility evidence of selection""**.

I'm really curious what you think about these ideas, which can be very live, and generate a lot of name-calling and hot debate in scholars who are normally reserved. My own research is increasingly bringing me to similar intersections of science and humanities, but I really believe that this has to be a two-way street. It's not only the 'hard sciences' taking over literary studies that we need, but a place where they meet and acknowledge one another as useful disciplines. When I teach STEM students literature, something I really have to grind into them is that there is more in the world worth knowing that can fit in an excel spreadsheet - - but at the same time, we also have to acknowledge the utility of more data driven disciplines for literary work.

I finished reading *The Old Man and the Sea* a couple of days ago, and I want to start a discussion on it. 

This novel is so stripped down to the bare bones of narrative that it feels far more like a biblical parable, or a story out of a mythic tradition, than a piece of modern writing. Even compared to Hemingway's other works, *The Old Man and the Sea* is structurally far simpler. Just as some quick illustrations, while the character of The Old Man and The Boy do have names given in the text, they overwhelmingly referred to as just ""The Old Man"" or ""The Boy"". The lack of proper names places these characters in the realm of archetype rather than as fully fleshed out characters. Another example is the near-complete lack of interior access the reader has to The Old Man. Compared to Ishmael, who is overflowing with wit and perception that the reader is privy to, the reader is reduced surface dialogue in *The Old Man and the Sea*. 

As other's have mentioned, I think *The Old Man and the Sea* is about the pain of finding a purpose to life, but situated from the vantage point of someone who has already lived a big portion of their life. It mixes the desperate need to find a satisfactory place in the world, while also lamenting the reality that time will often give you a role to play. It's up to each of us to cope with our given role in our own way. The Old Man is a fisherman, and yet at times he question whether or not this was his purpose. He was a great fisherman in his younger days, and yet he has gone eighty-four days without catching a fish. 

I read the marlin is a physical manifestation of ""The Purpose To Life"". The Old Man comes face-to-face with what he's been truly searching for. The fish is a validation, or a confirmation, that he truly *is* a fisherman. His purpose to life is to fish, and all of his past success and failures have trained him for this encounter. This middle section of the book is perhaps my favorite because Hemingway transforms the existential psychological battle of finding a purpose to life into a physical exertion of wills between the Old Man and the Marlin. 

The Old Man begins to emotionally connect to the Marlin, and his perspective on the universe is widened. If it is his purpose in life to fish, what is the Marlin's purpose in it's life? What happens when our choices lead us into conflicting purposes? In *The Old Man and the Sea*, this dilemma is stripped down to the simple battle of a man and a fish, but it evokes the battle each of us faces when interacting the world at large. Every day, we come into contact with people, all of which are trying to find their way through life. Does chaos emerge or some sort of transcendent order?

Eventually the Old Man kills the Marlin. It is the ultimate validation of his own existence, but it is important that such a battle has taken him far beyond the limits of where he's typically used to going. The Marlin has dragged him far out to sea and far away from his island and society at large. I think Hemingway is saying that such validation cannot come from society or external factors. The battle to find one's place in the universe is an internal battle which cannot be brought back into society. 

As the Old Man tries to bring his Marlin/validation back home, sharks rip the Marlin apart bit-by-bit. I think this is symbolic of the fact that one's own internal validation will necessarily be killed and torn when brought to the surface of one's mind. If one tries to bring that validation out into the world, the world/sharks will devour it. All that's left is the skeleton, a reminder of the internal struggle.

I'm curious about the Old Man's dreams about the African beach shores and the lions. It seems so odd that a man with eyes the color of the ocean would dream of land. Perhaps the Old Man is pondering the possibility of having lead a different life. His dreams contrast the reality of a man who's life is based on the sea to a life based on land. His dreams are a contemplation of what might have been mixed with a slight disappointment of having gone eighty-four days catching nothing, only to catch the largest fish he's ever seen and have it be devoured by sharks. Perhaps a life on land would have been better. Maybe he would have been a man with eyes the color of sand.

What are your thoughts? I'd love to hear them!

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, everyone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finished reading &lt;em&gt;The Old Man and the Sea&lt;/em&gt; a couple of days ago, and I want to start a discussion on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This novel is so stripped down to the bare bones of narrative that it feels far more like a biblical parable, or a story out of a mythic tradition, than a piece of modern writing. Even compared to Hemingway&amp;#39;s other works, &lt;em&gt;The Old Man and the Sea&lt;/em&gt; is structurally far simpler. Just as some quick illustrations, while the character of The Old Man and The Boy do have names given in the text, they overwhelmingly referred to as just &amp;quot;The Old Man&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The Boy&amp;quot;. The lack of proper names places these characters in the realm of archetype rather than as fully fleshed out characters. Another example is the near-complete lack of interior access the reader has to The Old Man. Compared to Ishmael, who is overflowing with wit and perception that the reader is privy to, the reader is reduced surface dialogue in &lt;em&gt;The Old Man and the Sea&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As other&amp;#39;s have mentioned, I think &lt;em&gt;The Old Man and the Sea&lt;/em&gt; is about the pain of finding a purpose to life, but situated from the vantage point of someone who has already lived a big portion of their life. It mixes the desperate need to find a satisfactory place in the world, while also lamenting the reality that time will often give you a role to play. It&amp;#39;s up to each of us to cope with our given role in our own way. The Old Man is a fisherman, and yet at times he question whether or not this was his purpose. He was a great fisherman in his younger days, and yet he has gone eighty-four days without catching a fish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the marlin is a physical manifestation of &amp;quot;The Purpose To Life&amp;quot;. The Old Man comes face-to-face with what he&amp;#39;s been truly searching for. The fish is a validation, or a confirmation, that he truly &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a fisherman. His purpose to life is to fish, and all of his past success and failures have trained him for this encounter. This middle section of the book is perhaps my favorite because Hemingway transforms the existential psychological battle of finding a purpose to life into a physical exertion of wills between the Old Man and the Marlin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Old Man begins to emotionally connect to the Marlin, and his perspective on the universe is widened. If it is his purpose in life to fish, what is the Marlin&amp;#39;s purpose in it&amp;#39;s life? What happens when our choices lead us into conflicting purposes? In &lt;em&gt;The Old Man and the Sea&lt;/em&gt;, this dilemma is stripped down to the simple battle of a man and a fish, but it evokes the battle each of us faces when interacting the world at large. Every day, we come into contact with people, all of which are trying to find their way through life. Does chaos emerge or some sort of transcendent order?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually the Old Man kills the Marlin. It is the ultimate validation of his own existence, but it is important that such a battle has taken him far beyond the limits of where he&amp;#39;s typically used to going. The Marlin has dragged him far out to sea and far away from his island and society at large. I think Hemingway is saying that such validation cannot come from society or external factors. The battle to find one&amp;#39;s place in the universe is an internal battle which cannot be brought back into society. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Old Man tries to bring his Marlin/validation back home, sharks rip the Marlin apart bit-by-bit. I think this is symbolic of the fact that one&amp;#39;s own internal validation will necessarily be killed and torn when brought to the surface of one&amp;#39;s mind. If one tries to bring that validation out into the world, the world/sharks will devour it. All that&amp;#39;s left is the skeleton, a reminder of the internal struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

The Google launch page at Google.com is her portrait today. Happy Birthday to a profoundly amazing writer. You are missed. 

Edit: Butler's books often deal with race, gender and genetics in strange and unexpected ways. Her work is now more prescient than ever. Her writing is simple, and straight forward, I love teaching her work because students often have no issue in understanding her writing, YET, the ideas she deals with are complex and ground-shaking. 

I'd be interested in hearing what others think of her work, in general. Thanks! 



**EDIT 2: Suggestions for reading Butler.** This is my personal order from best to least best in my humble opinion. Other people might have different opinions. 

1. The Xenogenesis Trilogy, republished in one volume in the year 2000 and retitled by the publisher as 'Lilith's Brood'. This trilogy is three books Dawn, Adulthood Rites and Imago. The Oankali descend on Earth after humanity has all but killed themselves on. They are here to rescue the survivors. Their price is steep, however. Issue of race, consent, and the ethics of genetics abound. This is Butler at her best. Dawn by itself is a powerhouse. 

2. The Patternist Series was Butler's first series of books. Chronologically, the series starts with Wild Seed, an amazing book set in the 17th and 18th centuries, the story involves the relationship between two immortals - Doro and Anyanwu. They struggle to live together over generations as Doro attempts to create a new race through a selective breeding program. Chronologically, the other books which follow show the results of Doro's experiments: Mind of My Mind, Clay's Ark, Survivor and Patternmaster.  The entire Patternist series was later republished as one volume, called Seed to Harvest. This volume excludes the book Survivor, which Butler ultimately regretted publishing and asked that it be taken out of circulation. She called it her 'Star Trek' novel. Original printings of this novel are worth about $100 bucks on ebay. 

3. Kindred, Arguably her most famous novel, Kindred is centered on Dana, a writer who travels back in time to meet her slave owning ancestors. Heavily influenced Ben Winters to write his book, Underground Airlines. 

4. Parable of Sower and Parable of the Talents. The Parable series is the darkest of her writing. This narrative is bleak and unflinching in the assessment of humanity. Not for the faint of heart. 

5. Bloodchild and Other Stories - A book of short stories many of which are clearly first drafts or attempts to hammer out ideas for some of her novels. The best story is Bloodchild, a story about humans ""having to pay the rent"" on an alien planet. 

6. Unexpected Stories, published posthumously from her papers. Not the strongest stories. 

7. Fledgling. Butler's take on vampires. This book was published as result of facing a bad case of writer's block while she was finishing the third, never-published book in the parable series.

It's a simple heartfelt story with a classic motif of turning fate, ending in a marriage and a rich benefactor.  Yet I was surprised that many critiques of the story speak very strongly of its influence as part of the realist movement in the later 19th century.  Many casting an eye on Eliot's commentary on psychological conditions, isolation, religious organizations, and even sexuality.

However, when I read it, I found myself struck by (in my opinion) what seem to be the far stronger (or at least more overt) influences of romanticism throughout.  Silas sequester himself alone in the wilderness, and in the end Eppie follows suit, denying an upper class life, preferring her garden, on which much time is spent in particular.  There is something of a sidenote at the end of the novel in which Silas original hometown is essentially swallowed by an emerging industrial urban sprawl that at once denies Silas the comfort of external affirmation (a separate issue that Eliot deleops here that I find inslteresting) but also simply makes for a message of returning to the fundamentals (nature) is desirable, but also an endangered experience.  And finally we have some semi-Gothic fairytalesque elements, with Silas being described as a witch doctor or warlock at times. 

Now I realize that novels rarely fit so nicely into categorization, and will have many influences regardless of how we like to normally define a certain work.  However, I find it interesting that if this was indeed to a be a work of realism, then there is a kind of tension present with the more romantic/gothic elements.  Attempting to portray/criticize reality, yet containing characters that are mystical and a series of plot devices too optimistic and contrived to be the kind of scathing commentary that I have seen some critics make it out to be.

See, the visual is so much similar to ""Princess Mee"" story, it is clearly inspired by Tolkien\'s poem.  \n        \nI also encourage to take a look at  [Stacie Orrico - (There\'s Gotta Be) More To Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUOcQnWbk_U)   and  [Evelyn Evelyn - You Only Want Me \'Cause You Want My Sister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhhVlxYaqgA).\n      \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \n   \nSo why would we need to interprete this nonsense poem? See, Tolkien\'s scientific interests included famous medieval mystic poem \'Pearl\', there\'re strong parallels between \'Pearl\' and \'Princess Mee\' (see [\'Tolkien, Eucatastrophe, and the Re-Creation of Medieval Legend\'](https://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1060&amp;context=journaloftolkienresearch) by Jane Beal, for example). And - Tolkien is the one who had said - no, no, the Pearl-Maiden is not so simple, it\'s not so about protagonist\'s daughter, maybe it\'s about his soul at all? So, it is only natural to follow Tolkien\'s own kind of logic.\n  \nBut Jane Beal said ""Princess is the writer-reader-viewer’s *anima*"" as if everything was explained, but it isn\'t foremost. And secondly, not fully adequate concept. Tolkien wasn\'t Jung\'s follower, he was Catholic Christian. If you remember what Feyerabend says about understanding of Nuer cosmology.  \n  \nWell, from Catholic pov. Jeffrey L. Morrow in [\'Seeking the Lord of Middle Earth: Theological Essays on J. R. R. Tolkien\'](https://books.google.ru/books?id=0qQoDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) drew attention to the garment of princess\', that it\'s so similar to how Mary has been portrayed down through the centuries. But you know, princess is described **only** with clothes and ""lovely was she"". Here I\'ve thoughts about Jung\'s Persona as clothes, per se (yes, return to Jung) - and then about Chesterton\'s reasoning, that man is not man completely without cloth (see \'Professors and Prehistoric Men\' and \'The Shadow of the Shark\'). \n&gt;The first is the fact that original sin is really original. Not merely in theology but in history it is a thing rooted in the origins. Whatever else men have believed, they have all believed that there is something the matter with mankind This sense of sin has made it impossible to be natural and have no clothes, just as it has made it impossible to be natural and have no laws. But above all it is to be found in that other fact, which is the father and mother of all laws as it is itself founded on a father and mother; the thing that is before all thrones and even all commonwealths.   \n&gt;(...)  \n&gt;In one sense, indeed, his view might be compared to the barbaric. He saw every creature and even every object naked. He did not understand that what clothes a thing is sometimes the most real part of it. Have you ever noticed how true is that old phrase, \'clothed and in his right mind\'? Man is not in his right mind when he is not clothed with the symbols of his social dignity. Humanity is not even human when it is naked.      \n&gt;(...)    \n&gt;When St. Louis said that extravagant dress was indeed sinful, but that men should dress well “that their wives might the more easily love them”, we can feel the age that is talking about facts, and not about fads. There was plenty of romance, indeed; we not only see St. Louis giving humorous judgments under a garden tree, we see also St. Louis leaping from his ship into the sea with the shield at his neck and the lance in his hand. But it is not a romance of darkness nor a romance of moonlight, but a romance of the sun at noonday.   \n\nAnd about Anattalakkhana Sutta.   \n \n&gt; Form, ... feeling, ... perception, ... [mental] fabrications, ... consciousness is not self. If consciousness were the self, this consciousness would not lend itself to dis-ease. It would be possible [to say] with regard to consciousness, \'Let my consciousness be thus. Let my consciousness not be thus.\' But precisely because consciousness is not self, consciousness lends itself to dis-ease. And it is not possible [to say] with regard to consciousness, \'Let my consciousness be thus. Let my consciousness not be thus.\'...     \n&gt; Thus, monks, any form, ... feeling, ... perception, ... fabrications, ... consciousness whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right discernment as: \'This is not mine. This is not my self. This is not what I am.\'    \n\n\nMeanwhile, jungian ""The third stage of the anima is Mary"" and anima as a guide to death.   \n  \nThen \'Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses\' by Louis Althusser.   \n&gt; *Let us decipher into theoretical language this wonderful necessity for the duplication of the Subject into subjects and of the Subject itself into a subject-Subject.*  \n&gt;*We observe that the structure of all ideology, interpellating individuals as subjects in the name of a Unique and Absolute Subject is ___speculary___ , i.e. a mirror-structure, and doubly speculary: this mirror duplication is constitutive of ideology and ensures its functioning. Which means that all ideology is ___centred___, that the Absolute Subject occupies the unique place of the Centre, and interpellates around it the infinity of individuals into ___subjects___ in a double mirror-connexion such that it subjects the subjects to the Subject, while giving them in the Subject in which each subject can contemplate its own image (present and future) the ___guarantee___ that this really concerns them and Him, and that since everything takes place in the Family (the Holy Family: the Family is in essence Holy), ‘God will ___recognize___ his own in it’, i.e. those who have recognized God, and have recognized themselves in Him, will be saved.*  \n&gt;*Let me summarize what we have discovered about ideology in general.*   \n&gt;*The duplicate mirror-structure of ideology ensures simultaneously:*  \n&gt;*1. the interpellation of ‘individuals’ as subjects;*  \n&gt;*2. their subjection to the Subject;*  \n&gt;*3. the mutual recognition of subjects and Subject, the subjects’ recognition of each other, and finally the subject’s recognition of himself;*   \n&gt;*4. the absolute guarantee that everything really is so, and that on condition that the subjects recognize what they are and behave accordingly, everything will be all right: Amen – ‘***So be it***’.*  \n&gt;&gt;*Hegel is (unknowingly) an admirable ‘theoretician’ of ideology insofar as he is a ‘theoretician’ of Universal Recognition who unfortunately ends up in the ideology of Absolute Knowledge. Feuerbach is an astonishing ‘theoretician’ of the mirror connexion, who unfortunately ends up in the ideology of the Human Essence. To find the material with which to construct a theory of the guarantee, we must turn to Spinoza.*    \n\nThe proverbial guarantee:    \n&gt;***Only their feet***   \n&gt;***Could ever meet;***   \n&gt;***For where the ways might lie***   \n&gt;***To find a land***   \n&gt;***Where they do not stand***   \n&gt;***But hang down in the sky***   \n&gt;***No one could tell***   \n&gt;***Nor learn in spell***   \n&gt;***In all the elven-lore.***   \n  \nThese Stygian waters are rather absolute mirror. As for absense of stars in the bottomless well, look at [Apophatic theology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology), but surely the starry crown is reflected in the well (see above, Chesterton about garment).The usual connection of stars and pagan gods...  You can look for ""brochet tarakanoff"" concept in  ""T"" of Pelevin, for example. Human\'s void, human as just a circus stage for gods-actors. Remember [Show Must Go On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t99KH0TR-J4) by  Queen    \n   \n&gt;*Empty spaces, what are we living for*   \n&gt;*Abandoned places, I guess we know the score*   \n&gt;*On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for*  \n&gt;*Another hero, another mindless crime*   \n&gt;*Behind the curtain, in the pantomime*   \n&gt;*Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore*  \n&gt;*The show must go on*  \n&gt;*The show must go on, yeah*  \n&gt;*Inside my heart is breaking*  \n&gt;*My make-up may be flaking*  \n&gt;*But my smile still stays on*  \n   \nSo just see, death as a proof we are not just a stage:   \n&gt;***Shee was as light***  \n&gt;***As Mee, and as bright;***  \n&gt;***But Shee was, strange to tell,***  \n&gt;***Hanging down***  \n&gt;***With starry crown***  \n&gt;***Into a bottomless well!***  \n&gt;***Her gleaming eyes***  \n&gt;***In great surprise***  \n&gt;***Looked upon to the eyes of Mee:***  \n&gt;***A marvellous thing,***  \n&gt;***Head-down to swing***  \n&gt;***Above a starry sea!***        \n    \nWhile we live here on this earth we are lower than the angels. But when Christians enter heaven they will be higher than the angels because they will be the sons and daughters of the living God (John 1:12).     \n      \nAnd Death is proof of free will, we can always choose to be or not to be.   \n   \nWe don\'t see identification in the text. Well, we are dealing with Maria, not with gnostic Sophia. And Shee isn\'t just reflection, but concept of Other too.  We have the real \'Me\'e, take a look at the buddhist text above.\n    \nMeanwhile, the ordering of Princess\' perception  \n&gt;***She looked on high***  \n&gt;***To the roofless sky***  \n&gt;***And she looked to the shadowy shore;***  \n&gt;***Then round she went,***  \n&gt;***And her eyes she bent***  \n&gt;***And saw beneath her go***  \n&gt;***A Princess Shee***  \n&gt;***As fair as Mee:***  \n&gt;***They were dancing toe to toe!***  \n\nevokes Aquinas\' reasoning about aposterity of human self-knowledge.\n     \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    \n          \n&gt;*At once Jesus spoke to them, “Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid.”*    \n&gt;*Peter said to him in reply, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.”*    \n&gt;*He said, “Come.”*    \n        \nMatthew 14:27-29    \n                   \n&gt;*Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.*     \n&gt;*And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into His image with intensifying glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.*   \n                \n2 Corinthians 3:17-18    \n      \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------      \n     \n   So         \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    \n   \n&gt;*Praised be You, my Lord,*    \n&gt;*through* **our Sister Bodily Death,**  \n&gt;*from whom no living man can escape*  \n\nSaint Francis of Assisi, [Canticle of the Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canticle_of_the_Sun)   \n   \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    \n  \nElves are immortal, you remember this.  \n              \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    \n                \n*Out of the darkness of my life, so much frustrated, I put before you the one great thing to love on earth: the Blessed Sacrament. ....

Tolkien to Michael Tolkien 6-8 March 1941\n                      \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   \nWell, I\'ve reread \'Blindsight\' by Peter Watts and \'Neuropath\' by R. Scott Bakker pretty recently. And lots of Chesterton.   \nHonestly, I\'m not very-very fond of search of hidden meaning and all the criticism stuff. It\'s more likely the poem had undertaken the role of a center of crystallization of thoughts. You can see that I\'m not a professional literature-philosophy-religion researcher. I\'m just a humble programmer (a bit of computer vision, machine learning), so surely the line of thought lacks a lot, but still it\'s an interesting theme for me.       \nI would be grateful for critics and advices.

Which means that all ideology is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;centred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, that the Absolute Subject occupies the unique place of the Centre, and interpellates around it the infinity of individuals into &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;subjects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in a double mirror-connexion such that it subjects the subjects to the Subject, while giving them in the Subject in which each subject can contemplate its own image (present and future) the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;guarantee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that this really concerns them and Him, and that since everything takes place in the Family (the Holy Family: the Family is in essence Holy), ‘God will &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;recognize&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; his own in it’, i.e. those who have recognized God, and have recognized themselves in Him, will be saved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Let me summarize what we have discovered about ideology in general.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;The duplicate mirror-structure of ideology ensures simultaneously:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;1. the interpellation of ‘individuals’ as subjects;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;2. their subjection to the Subject;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;3. the mutual recognition of subjects and Subject, the subjects’ recognition of each other, and finally the subject’s recognition of himself;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;4. the absolute guarantee that everything really is so, and that on condition that the subjects recognize what they are and behave accordingly, everything will be all right: Amen – ‘&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So be it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;’.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hegel is (unknowingly) an admirable ‘theoretician’ of ideology insofar as he is a ‘theoretician’ of Universal Recognition who unfortunately ends up in the ideology of Absolute Knowledge. Feuerbach is an astonishing ‘theoretician’ of the mirror connexion, who unfortunately ends up in the ideology of the Human Essence. To find the material with which to construct a theory of the guarantee, we must turn to Spinoza.&lt;/em&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The proverbial guarantee:    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Only their feet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Could ever meet;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;For where the ways might lie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;To find a land&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where they do not stand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But hang down in the sky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;No one could tell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nor learn in spell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In all the elven-lore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These Stygian waters are rather absolute mirror. As for absense of stars in the bottomless well, look at &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophatic_theology""&gt;Apophatic theology&lt;/a&gt;, but surely the starry crown is reflected in the well (see above, Chesterton about garment).The usual connection of stars and pagan gods...  You can look for &amp;quot;brochet tarakanoff&amp;quot; concept in  &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; of Pelevin, for example. Human&amp;#39;s void, human as just a circus stage for gods-actors.

Well, we are dealing with Maria, not with gnostic Sophia. And Shee isn&amp;#39;t just reflection, but concept of Other too.  We have the real &amp;#39;Me&amp;#39;e, take a look at the buddhist text above.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the ordering of Princess&amp;#39; perception  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;She looked on high&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;To the roofless sky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;And she looked to the shadowy shore;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then round she went,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;And her eyes she bent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;And saw beneath her go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Princess Shee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;As fair as Mee:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;They were dancing toe to toe!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;evokes Aquinas&amp;#39; reasoning about aposterity of human self-knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At once Jesus spoke to them, “Take courage, it is I; do not be afraid.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Peter said to him in reply, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;He said, “Come.”&lt;/em&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Matthew 14:27-29    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into His image with intensifying glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 Corinthians 3:17-18    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So         &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Praised be You, my Lord,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;our Sister Bodily Death,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;from whom no living man can escape&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saint Francis of Assisi, &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canticle_of_the_Sun""&gt;Canticle of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elves are immortal, you remember this.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Out of the darkness of my life, so much frustrated, I put before you the one great thing to love on earth: the Blessed Sacrament. .... There you will find romance, glory, honour, fidelity, and the true way of all your loves upon earth, and more than that: Death: by the divine paradox, that which ends life, and demands the surrender of all, and yet by the taste (or foretaste) of which alone can what you seek in your earthly relationships (love, faithfulness, joy) be maintained, or take on that complexion of reality, of eternal endurance, which every man&amp;#39;s heart desires.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From a letter of J.R.R. Tolkien to Michael Tolkien 6-8 March 1941&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#39;ve reread &amp;#39;Blindsight&amp;#39; by Peter Watts and &amp;#39;Neuropath&amp;#39; by R. Scott Bakker pretty recently. And lots of Chesterton.&lt;br/&gt;\nHonestly, I&amp;#39;m not very-very fond of search of hidden meaning and all the criticism stuff. It&amp;#39;s more likely the poem had undertaken the role of a center of crystallization of thoughts. You can see that I&amp;#39;m not a professional literature-philosophy-religion researcher. I&amp;#39;m just a humble programmer (a bit of computer vision, machine learning), so surely the line of thought lacks a lot, but still it&amp;#39;s an interesting theme for me.&lt;br/&gt;\nI would be grateful for critics and advices.        &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': True, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': None, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2r6jm', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': '8jeth1', 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'crnislshr', 'num_crossposts': 4, 'num_comments': 18, 'send_replies': True, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/tolkienfans/comments/8jeth1/little_princess_mee_and_selfawareness_my_mindmap/', 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/8jeth1/little_princess_mee_and_selfawareness_my_mindmap/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 65925, 'created_utc': 1526324061.0, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",,self.tolkienfans,0,False,0,False,False,8sfv2m,False,False,False,False,False,False,,,,[],,,dark,text,False,,{},False,,,,[],t3_8sfv2m,False,0,0,,False,all_ads,/r/literature/comments/8sfv2m/tolkiens_little_princess_mee_and_a_christian_pov/,False,,6,False,,,False,4,,{},,,True,False,False,literature,t5_2qhps,r/literature,349754,public,,,"Tolkien's ""Little Princess Mee"" and a Christian POV on Self-Awareness/Free Will/Death : mindmap",4,https://old.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/8jeth1/little_princess_mee_and_selfawareness_my_mindmap/,[],,False,all_ads,6

I must admit, that whatever is its meaning and intention, it is masterful crafted and at the end, pretty funny, with its satirical use of hyperbole, metaphores and description of human bodily exertion. I won't lie, it was a fun read.   
&amp;nbsp;       

The synopsis is that Strephon sneaks into his lover Celia's room. At first, he likens Celia to a Goddess (notice the stereotypical classical Greek names), but then he finds all her dirt cosmetic products, vividly described in the most grotesque language possible. The climex is when he finds and peers into her crapper, which is described like Pandora's box.     
The last few verses describe how thereafter, Strephon can't look at a beautiful woman without being reminded that they are human amd gross too.        
&amp;nbsp;        

After reading, I delved into various interpretations. First of all, there's the feminist reading: the poem is meant to criticize ""womanly vanity"" and display woman as crooks that use various ointments to achieve an illusion of beauty.       
Another reading views it as mostly mocking Strephon and his initial naiveté, as he views Celia as a goddesses, but in truth, she's only human like him. In that reading Strephon signifies society and how it views the ideal woman, and Celia signifies women, who are just human like man, and all the same gross.        
&amp;nbsp;        

I believe that it's a combination of the two. It's probable that Swift was misogynist, as it was the 18th century after all and so, I think it was in part a misoganyistic attack on ""female vanity"". But I think he also wanted to satirize how in art and back in the time, woman were viewed in an idealizing eye.       
It sort of reminds me that copypasta where the guy was so horrified to discover his girlfriend was shitting that he kicked her out and vowed never to be with a woman that shits.

All conditioning aims at that: making people like their unescapable social destiny.*'  

I recently finished reading *Brave New World* by Aldous Huxley, and it's for me one of those reads that get you into a contemplative mood and stay in the back of your mind long after you have put the book down, refusing to let go and compelling you to toss and turn it over and over in your head.  

It's been a few years since I read *1984* by George Orwell - another prominent dystopian novel that's often brought up in discussions of *Brave New World* and vice versa - but I distinctly remember feeling this strange mix of unsettlingness and morbid curiosity while reading it due to some of the concepts it delineates and the underlying idea that these could come to pass in practice in the future and may in fact be happening in the present reality. And now while reading *Brave New World*, I felt something similar, but the unsettling feeling was only more intense in this case.  

I gave it some thought and I feel like it's chiefly because, while *1984* presents a totalitarian regime that controls its subjects by means of coercion and perpetual surveillance, *Brave New World* depicts a 'softer form of totalitarianism' - as Margaret Atwood puts it in her introduction to the novel - and yet a highly effective one where people are psychologically conditioned to unquestioningly accept their predetermined functions in society and whatever else is meted out to them in life. It's not merely that they're deprived of any alternatives, but they're also inherently *incapable* of feeling the need for an alternative in the first place. It's one thing to be coerced into a way of life that you *know* you're unhappy with but have seemingly no way to escape from, but it's another thing altogether to have your psyche be deliberately configured in a way such that not only you don't realise the gravity of your own situation but also you find *satisfaction* in it and can't comprehend the idea of anything outside of it.  

Essentially, the very concept of free will is done away with. This is a world where one's role and functions in society, their preferences and inclinations, and their dominant personalities, attitudes, outlooks, and quirks are all predetermined at the stage of one's conception, and then later reinforced through a series of systematic behavioural conditioning sessions to the effect that these become synonymous with what we call instincts ('As if one believed anything by instinct! One believes things because one has been conditioned to believe them.'). No one really has the choice to *explore* and decide for themselves what they want or do not want, not because they're being held at gun point but because they've been *programmed* to be content with the existing state of affairs to the extent of never wanting to consider having things any other way (and when any glitch in the form of overwhelming emotions or deviating thoughts pops up, it's promptly terminated with a dose of *soma*). Neil Postman put it succinctly in *Amusing Ourselves to Death*: 'What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one'.  

And to me, from a third-person perspective that lies outside the system of this world, such a scenario is terrifying and tragic.  

This realisation hit me like a truck when at one point towards the end of the novel, the Savage - John - attempts to incite the lower-caste Deltas into rebellion against their subservient way of life and against *soma*-intake as the society's legally sanctioned means to quell any emotion deemed undesirable, but in vain. The Savage's emotionally-charged words fall on deaf ears as the Deltas have been deliberately engineered to possess inferior mental faculty, rendering them incapable of comprehending anything outside the requirements of their menial jobs. The mental image of hundreds of Deltas and Epsilons with indistinguishable faces filing in and out of elevators and going about their monotonous jobs (which, owing to their conditioning, they don't find so) reminded me of the Hands - the factory workers who have been dehumanised and reduced to only a pair of hands by their capitalist maters - in Charles Dickens' *Hard Times*. But while the Hands are at least *aware* of their circumstances and how these circumstances affect them even if they can't do anything about it, the common masses of the World State are bereft of even the luxury of self-awareness.   

That being said, perhaps the true ingenuity of *Brave New World* lies in the author's ability to simultaneously convince the reader of the appeal and upsides of the book's universe for those who inhabit it specifically and also in general terms, while also conveying this lingering feeling of there being something very wrong with this world - walking the fine line between utopia and dystopia.   

A well-crafted dystopia is one that expertly wears the garb of a utopia, and the World State certainly passes this test with flying colours for the champions of this society do make some sound arguments in its defense, and one almost wants to *believe* them. For instance, they do have a point in that a great deal of misery in life often stems from dissatisfaction with one's obligations - their jobs, responsibilities, and roles - but if people are made to like what they've got to do, then there's no scope for dissatisfaction in the first place, and it follows then that everyone's happy with their life. At one level, it sounds convincing enough. Rather than having a bunch of unhappy employees slaving away at their workstations, wouldn't it be a more desirable situation to have these employees be conditioned in a way such that they find the work pleasant? The employer wants to get work done and the employees are always happy to do it, regardless of the nature of the work. That makes it a win-win situation for both the employer and the employees.   

And *yet*, there's something about this whole thing that feels wrong deep down.   

As far as my understanding goes, it's because the implication of such an arrangement is that people are being stripped off their free will and power to make informed choices. As humans, we're distinct from other animals in our self-awareness and intelligence, and in a way that's both a blessing and a curse. By taking away the power to think and explore and take decisions for *ourselves*, and limiting us to a set of predetermined configurations, we're in effect being deprived of what makes us *human*.   

The people of World State have paid their price for 'happiness and stability'. Do *we* want to? It's not quite a black-and-white picture, and this ambivalence is what makes *Brave New World* so utterly intriguing and thought-provoking.

I just finished Faulkner's *Light in August* last night after an admittedly rough couple months trying to get through it. I am also no stranger to Faulkner, having read 5 other novels by him. I consider him to be my favorite author, and *The Sound and the Fury* remains my favorite novel of all time by far. With this in mind, I knew I needed to grapple with this novel at some point, it being the only one of his four 'masterworks' many critics and fans alike claim to be his best. So I dove in, and have a few thoughts on the book. First of all, I truly believe the book is about 100-150 pages too long. The book seems to drag in many points, and even as someone who can enjoy the Faulknerian pacing and lyrical flourishes in prose, much of it seemed rather inconsequential to the narrative arc as a whole. That being said, the plot was fascinating, and featured some of Faulkner's most memorable characters. While Lena seems to fit pretty narrowly into the standard Faulkner ""sympathetic fallen/sullied woman"" category, Rev. Hightower and Joe Christmas provide a very cool character study. Joe Christmas's struggle with his mixed race heritage was not quite as well fleshed out as it gets with the Sutpens in *Absalom, Absalom!* in my opinion, but the scene where Joe was running back and forth between the white and Black sections of Jefferson was nothing short of phenomenal. Rev. Hightower's arc was also interesting, and the scene in which his life flashes before him and he mentally and spiritually prepares for death very much reminded me of *Ray* by Barry Hannah. (Does anyone know exactly how much Faulkner influenced his fellow Mississippian?) The plot kept me very much paying attention when Faulkner actually pushed it forward, but he lost me more than once in his forays off into his own writing. Faulkner's attention to detail on the human psyche and his undertanding of America and its many complex and curious attitudes remain unparalled, but his clumsiness on matters of race and gender still do remain. (I do think most fans of Faulkner still acknowledge and accept this, even me as a Black person) Overall, the book clearly has merit and gave me some incredible characters and scenes to remember, but I find it to be the least enthralling of Faulkner's masterworks, and it honestly probably comes to 5th of the 6 Faulkner novels I've ever read. At any rate, it's still a cool book, and a phenomenal intro to Faulkner due to its lack of narrative experimentation. 

What do you all think of the book, or Faulkner in general? Am I off base in my criticisms?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;a href=""/r/Literature""&gt;r/Literature&lt;/a&gt;, I have a few thoughts on a recent read and wanted to see who might discuss with me.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not a literary person so what I say might be kinda BS-y, and also long, but whatever :P Before you read this, I want to say that my goal is to see how BS-y this is, and also if anyone else relates to this :)

I discovered Waiting for Godot as a sophomore in college; I enjoyed it very much, but couldn't quite place my finger on why. It faded from my memory until recently, when I pulled it out of my closet and watched it. Before this past week I had thought I might only be liking it because it was edgy, or because of the existential philosophy it contained, etc. However, I realized this past week that what might attract me to this particular play is much simpler and deeper than I originally thought; I think that this play speaks to me the most because it feels so very much like an ordinary day for me.

When you watch a movie, you can feel the attempted atmosphere emitting from the television; perilous, danger, humour, happiness, and so on, depending on the film. But when the person is me and the film is Waiting for Godot, there isn't a shift; it's more than it just being a quiet, laid back film, it's that it jives with how I take in the world so well that it blends into the background. I just honestly relate to the feeling of this film in the sense that the mood of the film is the mood of my existence.

The statements I have made are things of which I am certain, but I was also trying to think of some stronger parallel, some stronger interpretive reason that I should be so similar in feeling to this film (hence the start of possible literary-interpretation-from-a-mathematician BS). The best thing I could come up with is the following odd-as-fuck interpretation, which might honestly only apply to me (but I want to know whether or not I'm alone here!)

I feel close to Vladimir and Estragon because I feel as if, upon reflection, my thought process is similar to the manner in which they talk to each other. The buzz interchanged with the utter silence, the slight thoughts of suicide that honestly aren't even serious in nature, something just to ""pass the time"", the suspicion of outsiders, the confession that they are happier together but will continue to stick together anyways because in some sense each needs the other to validate their own existence. I think there were about 20-30 times throughout the movie that some exchange of theirs or another hit home to me, whether it was because of the dialogue or the mood during their exchange.

Continuing this, I would need to give interpretation for everyone else. I think that Pozzo and Lucky are my ""bad"" and ""good"" emotions respectively. I don't feel things very often, so it fits well with the fact that they are almost never present in the film; they just sort of trot in and out as they please. Pozzo is the greed, the gluttony, the angst, cunning, kniving, pompous, proud, arrogant, while lucky is the silent happiness, the hope and the joy. 

(In case you couldn't already tell, I'm very much depressed; stable and ok, but depressed). 

I like this parallel because Pozzo overpowers Lucky, commands him, and Didi and Gogo are quick to follow him in disparaging the usefulness / goodness of Lucky. There are stronger parallels, but I'm running out of steam with my typing here.

Finally, what is to be said of the young boy(s) and, most importantly, Godot? This took me a while to come up with, so this might be the square peg in the round hole that I needed to have a complete analysis, but I feel as if the boy is the in-between, the relay between myself (everyone else in their collective oddities and interpretations) and other people. To me this honestly fits well with my daily life, in the sense of overthinking what people think and being paranoid because you can never truly know what is going on to someone else, only what is happening in your own mind; that suspicion is reflected especially by Didi at the end of the second day. How can you even verify the existence of another, let alone that another has received the message you wish to send, if your own existence seems to so frailly depend on yourself to confirm?

Please tell me if I'm just full of crap / if you relate / anything else, because I honestly just enjoy this play no matter what :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a realization this past week and I wanted to share it and hear what people think.

It's one of the most engaging and passionate novels I've read. To manage to create something readable and shapely out of uncontrolled passions is a real feat of sophistication that I think is rightly admired. I certainly liked that. 

Complexity is a good word to describe this novel. For me: Heathcliff's a tough kid, and I like that; Heathcliff and Cathy Earnshaw are really a match for each other; Heathcliff and Cathy have real self-destructive traits; Cathy should get a grip of herself; Cathy's marriage to Edgar Linton was not such a good idea; Heathcliff is a monster because he marries a woman he hates for the sole purpose of destruction; Heathcliff is nasty because he treats Linton Heathcliff and Hareton so meanly; Heathcliff still captures some of my sympathy because of his passion, which may have a redemptive quality to it; Heathcliff's desire for revenge admirably wanes; Heathcliff is a monster but a really lovelorn and intense one. I like the book because it allows me to feel all these things as the story progresses without any of these feelings being wrong.

I don't think the characters here match the ""likable"" classification well, though Cathy Linton comes close to it at times, and Nelly Dean is our friendly neighborhood storyteller and it is partly her narration and partly the brilliance of Brontë's writing that keeps me engaged. The dialogue is theatrical and elevated and in the Romantic fashion, but I think for a novel about elevated feelings and intense passions, I think that ""artificiality"" is the right tone. 

I think in addition to being a masterpiece of story and passion, Wuthering Heights is really a work of technical genius; it's like The Scarlet Letter in using intense emotions in controlled form, though Brontë's style is much more complex and thus a grander achievement. I like how Lockwood's the frame narrator and Nelly Dean's the real storyteller. At the same time, Isabella Linton, Heathcliff, Zillah, Cathy get their parts. To do all of this in the span of several hundreds of pages and still keep me engaged—that's really admirable.

I admit I need to reread it as I think that's the way Wuthering Heights will grow on me. After all, rereading led me to have a greater appreciation of Shakespeare's plays, of Homer's epics, of Milton's Paradise Lost, and more. 

I also should read more women writers. More of the Brontës, Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf, Flannery O'Connor (I've read most of her stories and her novel Wise Blood), Donna Tartt, etc.—there's a lot to explore. 

I admit the second-generation stuff with Heathcliff being an outright monster could feel dragging and relentlessly unhappy at times, and I feel that when Cathy Earnshaw disappeared something else went away from the story. That being said, the book picks up a lot near the end, and Lockwood's last words that conclude Wuthering Heights have a special quiet brilliance.

Highly recommended.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wuthering Heights is something I&amp;#39;m glad I read.

A young puritan man goes for a walk in the woods before sunset, leaving his wife, Faith, and meets the Devil along the way. 
The devil tells him that every one he knows, even his father and grandfather, have been friends of his and have done evil things in his name. 
It all culminates into Goodman Brown finding a Witches' Sabbath/ Devil worshiping service going on in the woods, and his wife, Faith, is about to be inducted into the cult. 

And the most iconic line of the story is ""I have lost my Faith!"" referring to his wife, but also being a very on the nose reference to Christian faith. Basically the story ends with Goodman Brown going home to his wife and isolating himself from everyone in his life because he thinks they are evil witches, and he dies with a reputation of being a cold, distant man with no friends. 

Guys, I just realized when he says ""I've lost my faith"" He wasn't referring to his faith in God or his wife, he was talking about his faith in people.

I thought that every now and again I might bring my selections here to start some discussion and get some perspectives on some of the things I'm reading.

The only other Dicken's I had read befor bring hiswas Great Expectations, so I was pleased to find that Nickleby contains some similar elements in story and tone that draw me to this kind of literature.  It's overly optimistic, many of the characters, especially the protagonists (as is often the case) are archetypal and lack nuance (which is funny, as Dickens preface indicates that Nicholas was seen as something other than perfect, although I strain to find him struggling with any kind of internal flaws at any point, he seems to be our moral compass throughout...), the plot is driven by convenient cotrivances, and is somewhat bloated (thanks to the publication methods o the time I gather) for its overtly stated purpose to discredit Yorkshire boarding schools.  And I loved it, every little bit of it.  Predictable, yes.  But humorous, beautiful, and fascinating in the way it unravels.

Jill Muller wrote the introduction to the B+N edition I own, and sheds a fascinating light on the novel.  She speaks mainly to the theatricality of the work, that it draws it's strength from, and attention to the artificiality of its substance.  Thus we are drawn behind the curtain of a sham acting troupe, and various characters (Noggs, Squeers children, the people Miss La Creevy Paints) showcase the theatrical artifice of society.  Perhaps not commenting on it, but subtly revealing the power, prevalence, or just the humor of this notion. 

In semi-connection to this, I also read Anti-Clerical Gothic: The Tale of the Sisters in ""Nicholas Nickleby"" by Rodney Stenning Edgecombe which cleared up, to some extent, some confusion I had over the purpose of the framed story telling near the beginning.  Edgecomb posits that this, again, is part of the intricate artifice woven into the text.  The story of the sisters  is a tale of origination entirely fabricated by Dickens in the style of such folklore, but one that was often mistaken for a true folktale, reality mimicking art and all that.  Edgecomb also further elaborates on the possible ways this revealed Dickens religious views.  The ascetic and dower depiction of the clergy contrasted with the reverent, yet decadent maidens serves to show the need to allow enjoyment of life to coincide with religious service.  

To finish my ramblings, I was specifically interested in the inspirations Dickens takes here from Cervantes.  I recently read Don Quixote for the first time and the connections stand out now, but I believe service the novel well, rather than detract from it.  The hero and his dimwitted but loveable sidekick go on a picaresque adventure that reveals small truths or makes small observations about various members of society.  Lambasting real life plagiarizers who were attempting to cash in on the novels success.  The aforementioned commentary on artifice, deception or suspension of disbelief are in common here.  Even the chapter titles bear a sort of similarity I find amusing.

So, I'm not necessarily looking for a response to my reaction to the novel, but want to hear all your takes on it.

It is quite amazing to me the way that certain literatures will hold no relevance in one's mind until it absolutely needs to, and the way that certain lessons simply cannot be learned until one has lived the appropriate experiences in their own life. I have read 100-150 pages of Eden before about 2-3 years ago, but it was mindless reading and I didn't retain much of it at all. This time around, however, I am devouring every word with such care and admiration for the delicate way he details the shortcomings of the human psyche, and of human morality, and I just.... I am in love.

I have long touted John Steinbeck as my favorite author ever since reading ""Of Mice and Men"" in high school, and even though the only other work of his I have read beginning to end is ""Travels with Charley in Search of America."" there is just something about his characterization that resounds with me, and, having read the first three chapters of ""Eden"" I think I can safely say that it is the impeccable way in which Steinbeck brings beauty, and innocence even, to the most monstrous of events and people. Combined with the heart breaking irony of Alice's misconception about the gifts being left around for her, and Adam's stubborn affection for Charles, I find it impossible to place any author I've ever read above him. Not to mention the beautiful and endearing way he paints such a vivid picture of the Salinas Valley, and details the history of the land. It gives me a whole new appreciation for the time I spent living in California just a few short hours away from his home. I am so excited to continue this beautiful piece of art, this time to completion, and finally explore more of his writing.

Combined with the heart breaking irony of Alice&amp;#39;s misconception about the gifts being left around for her, and Adam&amp;#39;s stubborn affection for Charles, I find it impossible to place any author I&amp;#39;ve ever read above him. Not to mention the beautiful and endearing way he paints such a vivid picture of the Salinas Valley, and details the history of the land. It gives me a whole new appreciation for the time I spent living in California just a few short hours away from his home. I am so excited to continue this beautiful piece of art, this time to completion, and finally explore more of his writing. &lt;/p&gt;

I recently resolved to understand the media I consume more. To achieve this, I decided to start to write essays about things that I watch or read. I just finished reading Ishiguro's A Pale View of Hills yesterday and decided to make it my first subject. This is the first analysis of a novel I have written in the best part of a decade (and my previous attempts, if I'm honest, were pretty much just my teacher spoon-feeding me an analysis of To Kill A Mockingbird). As a result, I am open to all constructive feedback regarding my writing.

If you have any other thoughts on this book, I would love to hear them.

Also spoilers, obviously.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

After the country’s defeat in the Second World War, Japan was occupied by the United States and its society began to change. The country experienced a shift away from its traditional values towards a more Western ideal. It is during this shift that A Pale View of Hills takes place. Through its characters, it shows the varying reactions of various characters – conservative and liberal alike. The focus of the book is largely on the oppression of women in traditional Japanese society – and I shall dedicated a large part of this essay to discussing its portrayal. However, the book also exists on a statement (and possibly a personal reflection on behalf of Ishiguro) on the role of culture in forming our personalities and perceptions of the world.

A Pale View of Hills suggests that the role of women in pre-war Japanese society was of servants to their husbands. They were not expected to have an identity of their own in the context of their family. Instead, they were expected to behave in accordance with their husband’s desires and living for their family, rather than for themselves. The view of women as servants is evident in Etsuko’s role in the discussions of Jiro and Ogata. Whilst Ogata and Jiro converse, Etsuko has minimal input and seems to exist mostly to serve food and tea, and prepare Jiro’s clothes. This is not the only instance of women serving men. In a conversation with Etsuko, Sachiko recalls how she, her cousin, and the housemaid would take it in turns to cook – yet she never mentions her uncle doing so.

Etsuko’s role during Ogata and Jiro’s conversations also shows the lack of women’s individuality inside their families. This is because whilst her husband and father-in-law converse she rarely plays an active part in the conversation – simply listening instead. Furthermore, it is seen as her duty to reflect her husband’s opinions in public. This is further shown when Jiro’s co-workers visit. Upon discovering that his wife intended to vote for a different political party, Jiro’s co-worker attempted to intimidate her into voting for his party. The fact that Jiro and Ogata then both agree that “husband and wife voting for different parties [is a] sad state of affairs” implies that Etsuko is expected to mirror Jiro’s views in public.

Additionally, A Pale View of Hills suggests that a woman’s identity is her family. This is shown throughout the book. The most constant way in which it is shown is through Etsuko’s activities. Throughout her time in Nagasaki, Etsuko was at home whilst Jiro worked long hours. This was not so much of a problem during the story as she had Ogata and Sachiko for company. However, both of them were merely there on a temporarily – with both leaving at the end of the book. Her future could be seen through Sachiko’s life with her uncle. The three women of Sachiko’s uncle’s household spent their lives tethered to the household – with boredom leading them to fight over who cooks. Sachiko later stated that she had nothing left at her uncle’s house other than “a few empty rooms” and the prospect of sitting there and growing old. This is compounded by the revelations of Sachiko’s cousin, who admits that she hasn’t visited town “since last spring”, presumably (in part) as her father is “too ill to leave the house.” Here we can see the expectation for women to simply stay at home instead of engaging with hobbies or friends – despite the fact that all that awaits them as boredom.

This expectation can also be seen in Mrs Fujiwara’s actions – or, perhaps more accurately, in Ogata’s reaction to her subverting society’s expectations of her. After losing her husband and all but one of her sons in the war, she decided to move on by setting up a noodle shop. Ogata considers this a “step down” as her husband commanded great respect – much more so than a noodle shop owner. The reason why he considers this a step down is because her status was seen as equal to that of her husband whilst he was alive – suggesting that her status mirrors that of her husband’s, rather than being the result of her own hard work. Indeed, Ogata regards her “circumstances” as pitiful rather than commending her for moving on and enjoying her laugh. The implication is that, from Ogata’s point of view, her status as an active participant in life effectively ended with her husband’s demise.

The Japan which A Pale View of Hills is one in which women have no individuality. The life of a woman is tied to her family. Her only activities are activities which serve her family. Her only successes are the successes of her family. Her opinions are those of the head of the family – her husband. Women are granted no agency. It is little wonder that Sachiko was so desperate to escape. She dreamed of her daughter becoming a business woman or a painter. She dreamed of her daughter having the agency to choose a life which she wanted.

Before Mariko could be free, Sachiko needed to find a way out of Japan. She saw an opportunity to do so in Frank, and thus pursued him. However, Frank took advantage of this. By promising to take her to America, Frank uses Sachiko (presumably) for sex. It is then found out that she is not the only woman he’s seeing, and Sachiko breaks it off with him. Finally, Frank gets her to come to Kobe with him when he moves there for work. He will be working on a cargo ship and told her he’ll leave for America to find a job before paying for her to come with him. It does not say what happens but, judging by his history, the assumption is that he is using her again. This implies that, whilst women in Japan may be oppressed, Western men are hardly all benevolent. Another implication of this is that there is merit in the Japanese view of dating as it protects the woman from manipulation. This is because dating in Japan traditionally happened after couples announced their engagement – casual dating only became widespread during and after the American occupation.

However, additional security during courtship can hardly be described as a huge advantage when the secure courtship can lead to a life of misery. Niki and her friends agree with this assessment when they laud Etsuko for her decision to lead Japan. Instead of graciously receiving their praise, Etsuko gives her daughter a sarcastic response. This is not the only time she is defensive regarding Japan. Whilst her second husband considered Jiro to be “oafish”, Etsuko defends him by claiming that her husband never understood Japanese culture, and that husband and wife have separate duties in Japanese culture. Nevertheless, these duties seem to restrict the lives of women much more than those of men. So why is Etsuko so defensive regarding Jiro and Japanese culture?

The reason for this is that Etsuko is still attached to her culture. This is not the only instance which shows that she still has an attachment to it. Twice – at the beginning and end of the book – she asks Niki about getting married and having kids (much to Niki’s chagrin). She also expresses surprise over one of Niki’s friends having a child out of wedlock at 19. This is all despite the fact that Etsuko is repeatedly shown to be liberal (compared to traditional Japanese values) in her conversations with Niki.

She is also not the only character which struggles with social change. The most obvious character which struggles against social change is Ogata – who perhaps serves the embodiment of Japanese conservatism. In his role as a head teacher before the Second World War, Ogata was a strict disciplinarian and even made the children frightened. Despite previously admiring him, Shigeo (amidst the post-war social change) begins to see the faults in Ogata’s teaching methods and publically chastises him (angering him in the process). Ogata also refused to denounce Japanese Imperialism in his conversation with Shigeo, and denounces technological innovations such as washing machines. Finally, as previously mentioned, he pities Mrs Fujiwara despite her moving on with her life.

The ways in which Sachiko struggles against social change, on the other hand, are slightly more nuanced than Ogata. Whilst she openly laments the lack of opportunity for women in Japan, she still seems to only desire to live through her family. We can see this through her pedestalisation of America as a land where her daughter can achieve her dreams – not where she herself can achieve them. In addition, even while she’s in Japan there is little focus on her working. Whilst she does get a job working for Mrs Fujiwara at the start, she does not work there for long. Even after her plan falls through with Frank, she decides that it would be better to go back to live a life of misery with her uncle than to work under the relatively progressive Mrs Fujiwara. She is content for her family to be her identity. Finally, this is not the only way in which she is attached to Japanese culture. After her plan to go to America fails, instead of admitting her mistake to Etsuko she decides to save face. This is relevant as saving face was and still is considered important in Japanese culture.

We can also see the hybrid nature of 1950s Japanese society in two of the supporting characters – Shigeo and Mrs Fujiwara. Whilst Shigeo is depicted as having radical and anti-authoritarian political views, he still adheres to Japanese social norms by inviting Ogata in for tea when he is confronted by him. Likewise, Mrs Fujiwara also upholds Japanese social norms by bowing excessively to customers, despite betraying other norms by owning her noodle shop.

It is also important to understand how the children respond to social change. Mariko and Keiko were both born in Japan and are resistant to leaving it. Whilst Mariko’s reasoning is due to Frank being “a pig”, we do not know why Keiko did not want to leave. However, we can see that she felt isolated in this new culture due to her reclusive tendencies. This sense of isolation was so severe that she eventually took her own life. Niki, on the other hand, was not born in Japan, and only experienced Japanese culture through her mother and reclusive half-sister. As a result of this, Niki is the most Westernised of all the named characters.

So what can we take from all of this?

A Pale View of Hills is a statement on the impact that our cultural upbringing has on our personalities, and that cultural evolution is a long process. Whilst the more progressive characters may extol Western values, they are all (barring Niki) still inextricably Japanese. The reason for this is because they were raised in a society with Japanese values. However, that does not mean to say that their values cannot change at all. Whilst Etsuko and Sachiko maintain somewhat conservative ideals in some aspects, they are both relatively liberal in other aspects (as seen by Sachiko wanting Mariko to have an identity of her own and Etsuko accepting the choices of Niki and her friends despite them seeming outlandish to her).

On the other hand, Niki seems to have no semblance of Japanese culture in her personality. This is a result of her being raised in the West – removed from traditional Japanese culture. One implication of this is that the children of others who emigrated to the West would also embody Western values. Another is that those who remained in Japan would also come to embrace Western values. This is a result of the changes that Japanese society was undergoing in the period in which the book was written. These changes would manifest much slower than in the children of emigrants, but they still would do so.

The book also suggests that Western society (and therefore the society which Japan is morphing into) also has problems. This is evident in Frank’s treatment of Sachiko, but also somewhat present in Etsuko’s second husband. Whilst Etsuko herself admits that she did not particularly like Jiro, she does not like her husband criticising him as it is a symptom of him misunderstanding Japanese culture. Jiro was simply a product of the Japanese culture which shaped many of the characters – not its progenitor. It is quite possible that, had he been born in Japan, Etsuko’s husband would have been a man like Jiro. Therefore, the book argues that whilst cultures may have negative aspects, to condemn or condescend to those who were raised in it just for having been so is hubris.

The book may also serve as a meditation of Ishiguro’s own life. Like many of the Japanese characters, he was born in Nagasaki – moving to Britain at the age of 5. It is possible that it is a statement of his own feelings of cultural isolation and nostalgia from Japan, as well as dealing with the misconceptions of people around him in Britain in the 50’s, 60’s, and 70’s. It is also possible that Ishiguro feels the same cultural divide with his parents as Niki did with her mother, and Keiko with Etsuko’s second husband.

In conclusion, A Pale View of Hills shows us that we are all products of our culture. We embody both the positive and negative aspects of it. However, that is not to say that we cannot change our societies for the better – it just takes time.

I just watched a BBC production of *Hamlet* after having read it a few months ago, and I wanted to share my thoughts. 

My interpretation of *Hamlet* is that Hamlet is a character who occupies two realms throughout the play- the realm of the everyday living or what we may call ordinary reality, and the realm of death where life is put into a much broader existential focus. To be more clear, Hamlet has a preoccupation with death that removes him partway from the day-to-day living and acting as the prince and heir of Denmark. The play details his transition from this halfway point to the realm of death (both when he literally dies, but also when he fully accepts his inevitable death.)

In the beginning of the play, we have a scene where guards acting their rolls given to them by the state come across the Ghost. They are dumbstruck and terrified, and they immediately default to the scholar Horatio for instruction. This is noteworthy in that the guards, having encountered something other from the realm of Death, are unable to interact with it. They are blinded to the higher reality in acting out their given roles in society. They cannot communicate with death, and so turn to the scholar in the hopes that his knowledge may intervene.

Horatio has a false start. The Ghost is about to speak just as the cock crows signifying the arrival at dawn. All of Horatio's scholarly pursuits have given him a small chance in comprehending death, but bookish learning isn't quite up to the task. Hamlet, partway removed from this world, is the only person who communicates with the ghost of the late King Hamlet. 

So much of Hamlet's indecision, insanity, and inability to act is a result of his trying to operate in these different realms. I reject the idea that Hamlet simply ""goes insane"". That interpretation tends to trivialize and dismiss the inner workings of Hamlet. He isn't insane. Instead, he sees things on a much broader scale than the rest of us. He sees things that we do our best to avoid. 

We now arrive at the famous ""To be or not to be"" soliloquy. 

&gt;To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,

This is a man contemplating his place in the broadest sense possible. He is trying to make a choice between living, acting out his role, and suffering the day-to-day misfortunes which would accompany ordinary reality, or does he bring the other foot over into death. 

After *Hamlet* returns to Denmark from his pirate misadventure, he has become something of an agent of death. At this point, he soul is almost all in the realm of death, and his body is a marionette. He has accepted his death, as indicated by several exchanges with Horatio

&gt;Hamlet: To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole?

&gt;Horatio: 'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.

Hamlet has a perspective on all of life that allows him to imagine Alexander's body ground to dust and eventually mixing with the soil and being a part of all base uses. Even though Hamlet asks why the imagination doesn't think of these things, he's really asking why the imagination *normally* doesn't think of these things- clearly he is thinking them as he gives his speech.  Horatio gives the response of someone who has never thought of it before, he doesn't know. It's too queer. 

When Horatio tries to dissuade Hamlet from dueling with Laertes, the following quote is give:

&gt;We defy augury. There is special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be, tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all. Since no man of aught he leaves knows, what is't to leave betimes? Let be. 

Hamlet is talking about leaving the world of the living. He has accepted his death. 


As a last remark, I believe much of Hamlet's indecision can be understood as trying to navigate and find his place in these two realms. One could ask why Hamlet just didn't avenge his father's death once he learned that Claudius had murdered him? The answer is that such direct and immediate action would require him to still be fully immersed in the day-to-day character of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. Since he was ripped out of that character, he is unable to act. His father's death forced him to come face-to-face with death in a way he never before had experienced. He fully comprehends the finality and inevitability of death, and with that the foolishness of the day-to-day happenings of the world. The far more pressing concern of rectifying himself to his inevitable death is on his mind. Only once he fully anticipates his death and truly accepts it is he able to act out his vengeance. But at that point, he's something of an agent of death, and we have a cataclysmic eruption of death at the end of the play.

The criticism that they point towards some of the classics is sometimes just flat out wrong. For example, this quote about Catch 22, ""It fails to capture the absurdities and impossible conflicts of war,"" is hyperbolic at best. I have my own issues with Catch 22, but arguing that it doesn't capture the absurdities of war is just objectively incorrect.

Because I just finished David Foster Wallace's collection of essays *Consider the Lobster*, and because the number of articles posted without any user commentary is too damn high, I wanted to start a discussion. 

To me, the most intriguing thing about DFW's writing is his focus on contemporary American issues that many of the older great writers didn't/couldn't write about. Wallace's insights into the nature of marketing, it's corrosive effect on political morale, entertainment, and alienation, all feel fresh and genuine. Moreover, he is young enough to have been immersed in rampant marketing his entire life. It was a reality to him, as well as many of us, as opposed to the oddity is would have been for an older generation. There's an immediacy to Wallace's writing and themes which just doesn't exist in a *Blood Meridian* or *The Sound and the Fury*. Whether or not his writings will transcend his generation like *Gatsby* did, or will it prove to be too provincial, will be determined by time. 

My personal favorite of the essays was *Joseph Frank's Dostoevsky*. In it, Wallace critiques contemporary American art's inability to confront ideology, moral conviction, with any depth. Wallace posits that art has been predominantly used as a destroyer or critic of ideology, rather than bolstering any coherent worldview. Thus, a Dostoevsky could not emerge in modern American culture, even if an individual had his talent and convictions. Irony and aloofness seem to be a predominant feature of art. 

I agree to a large extent with what Wallace is saying, but I can't help but feel that the cultural homogeneity of intelligentsia St. Petersburg allowed a writer to truly become a ""national voice"". Dostoevesky needed to speak to or confront one intellectual horizon only. Can a national voice truly exist in multicultural America? Are we too fragmented in our values to universally love a writer?  

My least favorite essay was  *Big Red Son*- an expose of the Adult Video Network awards and the porn industry at large. In the hands of a writer and observer like DFW, I would have thought that this topic would be a veritable goldmine. Unfortunately, the essay falls flat and never seems to launch off of its base subject matter into more interesting considerations. I would hope he would have considered something like the warped sexual aesthetic sensibilities that porn engenders. Or perhaps he could have considered the escalation necessary when sexual imagery is so pervasive as to become mundane. More and more exotic forms of sexuality are needed to elicit the same response. However, the essay never ventures into such interesting topics, and instead we get a fifty-plus page essay on how devoid of restraint or tact porn stars and producers are. Who would have thought?

This leads me to my greatest criticism of DFW. In hindsight, I'm not sure how novel or deep his observations truly are. He does a great job giving context to his insights which make them feel weighty. But how deep, for example, is the insight ""Elite athletes have an emptiness of mind which allows themselves to be wholly ingrained in the physical act of doing"" (this comes from *How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart*).

All in all, I thought it was a really solid, but uneven collection of essays. At his best, I think DFW was a generational talent.

Man has always ruminated on the nature of existence, be it through the cave paintings of the first humans or the contemporary literature of today’s world. As Man learned, however, we quickly discovered that the nature of reality was far removed from our own. The idea of fear at the dichotomy between objective reality and human understanding is present in many works, some even posing solutions to the problem of coping with a harsh universe. “Arcadia” by Tom Stoppard focuses itself with the idea of individual perspective as a bulwark against the daunting knowledge of the universe’s scale, chaotic nature, and eventual finality. 

The structure and non-omniscient third-person perspective present in the narrative of “Arcadia” allows for the audience to experience the play on the same level as its characters. Many key pieces of information are kept hidden from the reader throughout the play in the form of lost and/or limited knowledge. This presents an understanding of events through the lens of the characters involved, often limiting the audience’s knowledge strictly to what they have seen. This is atypical of many third person narratives that contain multiple coinciding storylines, which usually allow for the reader to maintain a greater understanding of events than the subjects of the work itself. Others have argued that the play’s temporal shifts do allow for a dichotomy between the viewpoints of the characters and the audience. One such critic, Derek B. Alwes, argues “…the larger focus conferred on us by the temporal shifts in the play enable us to recognize we can recover much of what has been lost” (398). Though the use of alternating time periods does provide the reader with a viewpoint of multiple situations, which the characters do not have, this knowledge is subverted by the complete loss or temporary inaccessibility of certain vital pieces of information in each situation; this breaks the semblance of the audience’s viewpoint being all knowing. The strongest example of this limitation is the letter from Byron that Septimus burns without ever opening. This focus on the frailty of knowledge throughout time reinforces the idea that the audience is meant to experience these events alongside the characters, not removed from them. 

Though the play’s perspective is largely humanistic, many of the themes it approaches are far beyond the scope of individual comprehension. Upon discovering Thomasina’s calculations, Valentine remarks that, though she had correctly identified the concept of iterations, she could not have fully solved them because “there wasn’t enough time before” (Stoppard 55). The human mind simply is not capable of reproducing the multitude of results that iteration equations require, and Thomasina did not live in a world with technology capable of testing her ideas. This incapability reinforces the play’s stance on the incongruity between the chaotic nature of the universe and the development of human understanding. Used as a similarly incomprehensible concept, the theory of entropy is discussed profusely throughout “Arcadia” and is symbolically represented by the degradation of certain characters and situations. At the conclusion of the play, two temporally separated couples are waltzing in the same room. One waltz, a potentially budding romance, is described as fluent while the other, between a mute and his unrequited love, is labeled as awkward. This scene metaphorically represents entropy; the room as a microcosm of the universe, with the dance and the relationship of its subjects having degraded over time. It has been argued that the interpretation of this degradation “as evidence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics operating in human civilization…would see the play as a tragedy” (Alwes 401). 

The symbolism of the waltzing couples is meant to illustrate the scale of entropy, however, rather than personal feelings towards it. The realization and acceptance of humanity’s place in the scale of existence causes the dissolution of social constructs and allows for individual assessment based on the perspective of the observer. This is evident when the final scene is examined even closer, and a second layer of meaning is revealed. From a metaphysical perspective, the waltz has degraded, indicative of entropy, but from Hannah’s individual perspective, this is a moment of intense triumph. After all, she has just been given absolute proof of her theories by Gus. 

The sharp contrast throughout the play between individual perspective and objective reality suggests that the only comfort when faced with the chaotic and arcane nature of reality is the assessment of the beholder. While developing her ideas about entropy, Thomasina laments over knowledge lost to the ages, asking Septimus how they may even sleep from the grief of such loss, to which Septimus replies: 

“By counting our stock. Seven plays from Aeschylus, seven from Sophocles, nineteen 	from Euripides, my lady! You should no more grieve for the rest than for a buckle lost 	from your first shoe, or for your lesson book which will be lost when you are old. We 	shed as we pick up, like travelers who must carry everything in their arms, and what we 	let fall will be picked up by those behind. The procession is very long and life is very 	short.” (Stoppard 42)

This assertion of his personal belief is used as consolation for the loss of knowledge, as well as as the resolution of individual mortality with universal immortality. A conversation in the contemporary period of the poem echoes this same idea. Valentine questions what motivates Hannah in the face of a nihilistic world, and her response contains a rationalizing of daunting knowledge through the use of her own perspective. Hannah’s answer mimics Septimus’ in a way that “the play itself performs an act of attempted wholeness, integrating the lives and ideas of the past and the present so that they question and answer each other dialectically” (Wheatley 175) The topic of sex is perhaps the greatest foil to the play’s metaphysical quandaries on perspective, and it is prevalent throughout the play. Almost every character in the story mentions and/or participates in sexual activity, usually depicted as baseless, shallow embrace as opposed to romantic love. This purposeful distinction is repeatedly made in order to represent sex as the ultimate embodiment of impulsive, individual action. It does not concern itself in any way with the metaphysical and timeless and is very personal in scale, a stark difference from the rest of the play’s themes.

The resolution of the play’s events details the respective outcomes of important characters to illustrate the results of their perspectives. Chloe’s character is the symbolic representation of sex as a purely impulsive act, evident when she is questioned about determinism in the universe. Her character arc mimics this in the final scene where she has engaged in a sexual rendezvous with Bernard which gets them both discovered, something Chloe handles rather unapologetically. The metaphor of her full embrace of impulsive carnality completes when, due to her lack of forethought, she is surprised by Bernard’s callous treatment of her, but still leaves relatively unaffected. Sexual embrace obviously has consequences, but the participants are not concerned with this in the moment of carnality; Chloe’s mild reaction to Bernard’s rudeness is a reflection of this apathy. The staunch opposite to this character arc is Septimus’. He begins the play as a sly womanizer, concerned with carnality over the metaphysical. It is during the final scene, after reading Thomasina’s report, that his perspective of life shifts: “It becomes clearer and clearer throughout the play, however, that it is the discoveries pioneered by Septimus' pupil which destroy the foundations of Septimus's faith. The laws of thermodynamics tell us that the world and the human race are no more immortal than we are as individuals” (Kramer 8). 

Shortly after, this is compounded upon by the simultaneous loss of perhaps his first true object of love, and he is driven mad by his knowledge of the nature of reality. Septimus spends the rest of his life in hermitage trying to reconcile his new objective knowledge with the loss of his faith and love. Having been stripped of the perspective that had previously given him comfort, he succumbs to the crushing burden of what he knows of the universe. Both of these characters aligned too heavily with their respective ideologies, ignoring information that fell outside of them, and were left with undesirable outcomes. The ideal example of the reconciliation of perspective with objective truth is found in the play’s protagonist, Hannah. The difference in her perspective is that is not absolute in either direction. Septimus ends up wearing away under the psychological weight of knowledge without emotion, Chloe is left stagnant by her impulsive distraction of knowledge with emotion, but it is Hannah who perfectly encapsulates a balance between the two. She is able to recognize and accept the objective meaninglessness of the world, while still finding personal purpose and motivation in her own life. 

“It's all trivial - your grouse, my hermit, Bernard's Byron. Comparing what we're looking 	for misses the point. It's wanting to know that makes us matter. Otherwise we're going 	out the way we came in. That's why you can't believe in the afterlife, Valentine. Believe 	in the after, by all means, but not the life. Believe in God, the soul, the spirit, the infinite, 	believe in angels if you like, but not in the great celestial get-together for an exchange of 	views. If the answers are in the back of the book I can wait, but what a drag. Better to 	struggle on knowing that failure is final.” (Stoppard 79-80)

Coincidentally, Hannah is the only main character that could be perceived to have a happy ending, and to truly benefit from the events of the play. 

“Arcadia” is a play that deals with abstract, esoteric discussion through the relatable scope of human experience. Whether viewed as a comedy, a tragedy, both, or neither, the play’s messages and ruminations resonate with its audience in a profound, timeless sense because of their poignancy to the individual as well as the whole of humanity.

Many key pieces of information are kept hidden from the reader throughout the play in the form of lost and/or limited knowledge. This presents an understanding of events through the lens of the characters involved, often limiting the audience’s knowledge strictly to what they have seen. This is atypical of many third person narratives that contain multiple coinciding storylines, which usually allow for the reader to maintain a greater understanding of events than the subjects of the work itself. Others have argued that the play’s temporal shifts do allow for a dichotomy between the viewpoints of the characters and the audience. One such critic, Derek B. Alwes, argues “…the larger focus conferred on us by the temporal shifts in the play enable us to recognize we can recover much of what has been lost” (398). Though the use of alternating time periods does provide the reader with a viewpoint of multiple situations, which the characters do not have, this knowledge is subverted by the complete loss or temporary inaccessibility of certain vital pieces of information in each situation; this breaks the semblance of the audience’s viewpoint being all knowing. The strongest example of this limitation is the letter from Byron that Septimus burns without ever opening. This focus on the frailty of knowledge throughout time reinforces the idea that the audience is meant to experience these events alongside the characters, not removed from them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the play’s perspective is largely humanistic, many of the themes it approaches are far beyond the scope of individual comprehension. Upon discovering Thomasina’s calculations, Valentine remarks that, though she had correctly identified the concept of iterations, she could not have fully solved them because “there wasn’t enough time before” (Stoppard 55). The human mind simply is not capable of reproducing the multitude of results that iteration equations require, and Thomasina did not live in a world with technology capable of testing her ideas. This incapability reinforces the play’s stance on the incongruity between the chaotic nature of the universe and the development of human understanding. Used as a similarly incomprehensible concept, the theory of entropy is discussed profusely throughout “Arcadia” and is symbolically represented by the degradation of certain characters and situations. At the conclusion of the play, two temporally separated couples are waltzing in the same room. One waltz, a potentially budding romance, is described as fluent while the other, between a mute and his unrequited love, is labeled as awkward. This scene metaphorically represents entropy; the room as a microcosm of the universe, with the dance and the relationship of its subjects having degraded over time. It has been argued that the interpretation of this degradation “as evidence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics operating in human civilization…would see the play as a tragedy” (Alwes 401). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symbolism of the waltzing couples is meant to illustrate the scale of entropy, however, rather than personal feelings towards it. The realization and acceptance of humanity’s place in the scale of existence causes the dissolution of social constructs and allows for individual assessment based on the perspective of the observer. This is evident when the final scene is examined even closer, and a second layer of meaning is revealed. From a metaphysical perspective, the waltz has degraded, indicative of entropy, but from Hannah’s individual perspective, this is a moment of intense triumph. After all, she has just been given absolute proof of her theories by Gus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sharp contrast throughout the play between individual perspective and objective reality suggests that the only comfort when faced with the chaotic and arcane nature of reality is the assessment of the beholder. While developing her ideas about entropy, Thomasina laments over knowledge lost to the ages, asking Septimus how they may even sleep from the grief of such loss, to which Septimus replies: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By counting our stock. Seven plays from Aeschylus, seven from Sophocles, nineteen    from Euripides, my lady! You should no more grieve for the rest than for a buckle lost  from your first shoe, or for your lesson book which will be lost when you are old. We   shed as we pick up, like travelers who must carry everything in their arms, and what we     let fall will be picked up by those behind. The procession is very long and life is very    short.” (Stoppard 42)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assertion of his personal belief is used as consolation for the loss of knowledge, as well as as the resolution of individual mortality with universal immortality. A conversation in the contemporary period of the poem echoes this same idea. Valentine questions what motivates Hannah in the face of a nihilistic world, and her response contains a rationalizing of daunting knowledge through the use of her own perspective. Hannah’s answer mimics Septimus’ in a way that “the play itself performs an act of attempted wholeness, integrating the lives and ideas of the past and the present so that they question and answer each other dialectically” (Wheatley 175) The topic of sex is perhaps the greatest foil to the play’s metaphysical quandaries on perspective, and it is prevalent throughout the play. Almost every character in the story mentions and/or participates in sexual activity, usually depicted as baseless, shallow embrace as opposed to romantic love. This purposeful distinction is repeatedly made in order to represent sex as the ultimate embodiment of impulsive, individual action. It does not concern itself in any way with the metaphysical and timeless and is very personal in scale, a stark difference from the rest of the play’s themes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resolution of the play’s events details the respective outcomes of important characters to illustrate the results of their perspectives. Chloe’s character is the symbolic representation of sex as a purely impulsive act, evident when she is questioned about determinism in the universe. Her character arc mimics this in the final scene where she has engaged in a sexual rendezvous with Bernard which gets them both discovered, something Chloe handles rather unapologetically. The metaphor of her full embrace of impulsive carnality completes when, due to her lack of forethought, she is surprised by Bernard’s callous treatment of her, but still leaves relatively unaffected. Sexual embrace obviously has consequences, but the participants are not concerned with this in the moment of carnality; Chloe’s mild reaction to Bernard’s rudeness is a reflection of this apathy. The staunch opposite to this character arc is Septimus’. He begins the play as a sly womanizer, concerned with carnality over the metaphysical. It is during the final scene, after reading Thomasina’s report, that his perspective of life shifts: “It becomes clearer and clearer throughout the play, however, that it is the discoveries pioneered by Septimus&amp;#39; pupil which destroy the foundations of Septimus&amp;#39;s faith. The laws of thermodynamics tell us that the world and the human race are no more immortal than we are as individuals” (Kramer 8). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after, this is compounded upon by the simultaneous loss of perhaps his first true object of love, and he is driven mad by his knowledge of the nature of reality. Septimus spends the rest of his life in hermitage trying to reconcile his new objective knowledge with the loss of his faith and love. Having been stripped of the perspective that had previously given him comfort, he succumbs to the crushing burden of what he knows of the universe. Both of these characters aligned too heavily with their respective ideologies, ignoring information that fell outside of them, and were left with undesirable outcomes. The ideal example of the reconciliation of perspective with objective truth is found in the play’s protagonist, Hannah. The difference in her perspective is that is not absolute in either direction. Septimus ends up wearing away under the psychological weight of knowledge without emotion, Chloe is left stagnant by her impulsive distraction of knowledge with emotion, but it is Hannah who perfectly encapsulates a balance between the two. She is able to recognize and accept the objective meaninglessness of the world, while still finding personal purpose and motivation in her own life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It&amp;#39;s all trivial - your grouse, my hermit, Bernard&amp;#39;s Byron. Comparing what we&amp;#39;re looking     for misses the point. It&amp;#39;s wanting to know that makes us matter. Otherwise we&amp;#39;re going  out the way we came in. That&amp;#39;s why you can&amp;#39;t believe in the afterlife, Valentine. Believe   in the after, by all means, but not the life. Believe in God, the soul, the spirit, the infinite,   believe in angels if you like, but not in the great celestial get-together for an exchange of   views. If the answers are in the back of the book I can wait, but what a drag. Better to    struggle on knowing that failure is final.” (Stoppard 79-80)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, Hannah is the only main character that could be perceived to have a happy ending, and to truly benefit from the events of the play. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Arcadia” is a play that deals with abstract, esoteric discussion through the relatable scope of human experience. Whether viewed as a comedy, a tragedy, both, or neither, the play’s messages and ruminations resonate with its audience in a profound, timeless sense because of their poignancy to the individual as well as the whole of humanity. &lt;/p&gt;

I just finished reading Euripides' *Medea*, and I wanted to start a discussion. I know Greek tragedy isn't the usual stuff posted here, but I think it's an important piece of literature/drama. This would also be a good way to start a discussion on the portrayal of gender roles in literature and how (mostly) women and (some) men have rebelled against those roles. 

Medea is an interesting character in Euripides' play, as she occupies a median between being sympathetic and not, and being classically feminine and masculine. She embodies classically feminine roles in abandoning her birth family and homeland to marry Jason, give birth to their children, and preserve his hereditary line. In several of her soliloquies, she speaks of motherly love to her children and of womanly desire for Jason and men in general. All of this was expected of a woman in classical Greece (and partly today as well.)

She also embodies classically masculine attributes, namely her participation in violent action and her scheming. Even before the murders she enacts in the play, she convinces Pelias's daughters to murder him, and she betrays her family and saves the voyagers on the Argo. She is an intelligent woman prone to action. She actually has many of the same attributes of the Greek Hero Odysseus. 

When Jason betrays her, she has absolutely no recourse to help herself within a conventionally feminine role. The chorus of women state in multiple instances that she is not the first woman to be betrayed by a man, and that she should simply accept her fate. This is the classically feminine respond, and it leaves her destitute. On the other hand, the masculine Jason will marry a princess and inherit a throne.

No man would be forced to accept such a fate acting in classically masculine roles. Medea, has no such option acting as a woman. Compare this to Ajax's belief in his slaughtering of his comrades in Sophocles' *Ajax* (he actually slaughters goats, but he is insane and believes he is slaughtering his comrades). He is never condemned for attempting to take vengeance, and his shame is that he was incapable of doing so. Violence and vengeance would be within the conception of masculinity, and so a man could at least enact retribution for spurned oaths and love. 

The point is that the entire classical conceptualization of what a woman is left her powerless in this situation. Thus, Medea made the choice to abandon that concept, and instead act as a man. Her embodying these dual characteristics allows Euripides to examine gender roles. Medea has enough femininity to suffer from the societal order, but she also has enough masculinity to rebel against it. 

With this forfeiture of her femininity, I think she also forfeit's her role as mother to her children. The entire societal order which is crushing her is literally patriarchal. Marriage serves the function to give men male heirs. Women are only biological necessity by which men pass down power to their male children. Motherhood is a tool needed to raise the family and preserve the male line. If Medea is going to rebel against this system, she literally cannot maintain her motherhood. Preserving her motherhood would preserve Jason's male line and the entire impetus of the oppressive societal structure. 

While Medea's actions are deplorable, they are absolutely necessary. Medea cannot rebel against a system of oppression while also keeping alive the very reason the system exists: male children. Is she morally justified in murdering her children? I find her at least sympathetic.

What do you all think? Is there more depth and nuance to Medea that I'm missing? Do you disagree with me about something? Comment!

Especially in Europe which is why slavery spread to the Americas. In the story, Mercutio is neutral to both houses and it is possible that he is a free slave.  This theory can also explain why he is friends with Romeo. Romeo is a person of high status, he certainly has the money, and has the loving parents to let him free Mercutio. We also know that Mercutio is a jokester and a lot of jokesters have tragic backstories. It is also possible that Lady or Lord Montague took Mercutio in, but this scenario is less likely due to Mercutio’s neutrality being hard to explain. Mercutio is the only neutral character introduced to the story alongside Friar Laurence and the police. Both 2 other characters can be related to slavery. It is very likely that the police have a relationship with Mercutio, because their decision not to execute Romeo on the spot. In the older times, people were stricter especially the police. The punishment for murder is hanging or execution. Nobody really cared about Mercutio for what we the readers know besides Romeo and Benvolio. Later in the story Benvolio betrays Romeo, so it is possible that Benvolio cares more about his mortality than his friends, or maybe he didn’t like them that much, or maybe a mixture of both. The only person that really cared about Mercutio was Tybalt when he felt guilt after accidentally killing him. This is assumed by the reader, but we know for a fact that Tybalt was hotheaded so it is very unlikely that he felt enough guilt to care about Mercutio. With Romeo dead, no one would care for Mercutio. Also, it is suggested that Tybalt had an affair with Lady Capulet, so she would feel sad. She probably wants Romeo to die for revenge so she would be happy too. The Montagues loved their Romeo, but eventually they would recognize that the law was the law and that no matter what they do, they can’t save him. Everybody except Romeo and Juliet believe that Paris is a much better husband suited for Juliet, so the Capulets would be happy. Juliet kept her love for Romeo because he was still alive and wanted to marry him after she escapes. She cannot love Romeo forever especially if he is dead. Unless she kills herself again, everything falls in to place. It all makes sense that the police should execute Romeo, but they didn’t. It isn’t like Shakespeare can’t write dark things and he was trying to appeal to the lower-class people. Many readers today say that he wasn’t executed because he did the right thing or something like that. However, in the time Rome and Juliet was set in, doing the right thing holds no power over the law. The only reasonable explanation for why the police would not execute Romeo is because of Mercutio. First, both them share the neutrality concept and since earlier in this theory, we assumed the police has a relationship with Mercutio, the police know that Mercutio likes neutrality and peace, which is the opposite of killing Romeo. They were not there when Mercutio said his last dying breath and plaguing the houses. They probably want the best for what Mercutio might want. Banishing Romeo is a closest way to keep neutrality, because the Montagues know that Romeo is not dead so they wouldn’t feel as sad. Lady Capulet will still be sad, but knows that Romeo will not bother her again. Also, Lady Capulet wants her daughter to marry Paris instead of loving Romeo.

Let me explain what I mean by this. Take Nabokov's *Pale Fire*, for instance. The work pokes fun at the idea of artistic criticism. Meanwhile, the novel itself is structured as a piece of artistic criticism, (a poem followed by a commentary) and for years after its publication, it has lent itself to loads of artistic criticism. It prods and laughs at that which its own elegance of form invites! 

Or take Stoppard's *Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead*. Here is a play about two goofballs walking around a play. Throughout the play, the audience is teased. We the audience begin to wonder: Do these characters know they are being watched?

This is a trend that I'm sure is well-documented in literary studies, but my basic question is this: Why aren't we simply satisfied with a good story anymore?

It seems a genuine, innocent story is no longer enough to satiate us. Is this a real trend, or am I exaggerating?&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe this is a bad post, more of an observation. I am curious to canvas opinion.

I've been reading Ulysses, slowly, for about 6 months now, without referring to study notes. Last week I finished the front nine and got through into chapter 10. I'm reading an e-copy and I was slightly appalled to notice that halfway through the chapters is only about a third of the way through the book.

I've never read Joyce before, and I took nothing but delight from the first four chapters of the book. The language, the erudition, the imagination on display were wonderful. Best of all were the characters. By the end of chapter 4, it almost felt like Stephen and Leopold were good friends. Masterful stuff.

Then, it began to fall apart. I do not believe there is much of literary value at all in chapters 5-7. They're dire, dragging, blowsy crawls through the tedium of everyday life. You could argue, of course, that 3 and 4 are similar. But it feels to me like those chapters delight in the minutiae of the mundane, celebrate it, use it to help the reader shine a light on the human condition. Chapters 5-7, by contrast, merely describe it. Without much of Joyce's more inspirational prose, either.

They only seem to exist, these chapters, to support the books' laboured analogy with Greek myth. I did read some students notes on these chapters, and it did nothing to disabuse my opinion. Indeed a couple of the books' fans seem to agree with me. If I'm right, I would argue that's a pretty big black mark against a novel, no matter how great the rest of it is.

Chapter 8 is better, back to the delight of trawling through Bloom's head. And while chapter 9 is impossible to follow unless you're a devotee of Hamlet I'll give it its literary merit for some curious arguments and - again - it advances both the characters of the book and its major themes, as well as some lovely language.

Now we're in chapter 10, and it's got that 5-7 feel again.

This windy bag of opinions is to say: aspects of this book are masterful. Beyond compare in my experience. Yet I can't help feel it's also pathetically self-indulgent. That it would have been an even better book as a whole if an editor had taken a very large knife to much of chapters 5-7 and 10. 

I'm carrying on, so we'll see how the rest measures up in terms of indulgence. But it's a shame there's as much as there is.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;a href=""/r/literature""&gt;/r/literature&lt;/a&gt;.

It seems clear he is emulating his modernist heroes like James Joyce (even his protagonist's surname is 'Bloom'), but unlike Joyce, Self's impressive vocabulary and love of wordplay feels, to me at least, strained and contrived more than anything else.

I'm a huge fan of Nabokov. Nabokov wrote in a bombastic style, with synaesthetic imagery, thesaurus-spanning lexis and peppered every sentence with punning wordplay. But whereas with Nabokov's writing I feel nothing but the warmth, humour and wit his erudite playfulness exudes, with Self all I feel is irritation. I guess the difference is that both men show how educated and talented they are, but only one of them, in my view, has a style that makes for good fiction.

Also I just couldn't stomach all the nastiness.

*Olaf Franke*

--------------------------------
*Analysis*

Franke was quite clearly influenced by the nonsense verse employed by poets such as Lewis Caroll in his *Jabberwocky* and Christian Morgensten's *Das Nasobēm*. It is quite genius in the way it distills the English language into its purest, rawest form, sound, assonance, dissonance, rhythm, rhyme. Indeed, as well as being a fine piece of imaginative literature, ‘The Globgogabgalab’ also demonstrates a central principle of language: what linguists call productivity or open-endedness, namely the phenomenon whereby users of a language can endlessly create new words or phrases. As Noam Chomsky has shown, users of a language demonstrate an innate linguistic creativity from a young age, and this is how children are able to pick up a new language relatively quickly: they learn not simply by acquiring knowledge, but by using an in-built talent for spotting how words are put together to form meaningful utterances. It can be considered a form of satirical verse, even, prompting the reader to question the nature of language and meaning and how they are interlinked. We are able to discern the central thrust and sluggish, bloated nature of the Globgogabgalab even though we do not know the meanings of the words specifically. It is this that the genius of Franke as a linguistic master shines through.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;

I never really disliked reading but only until recently I took and read books of fiction seriously. I even started going to a book club and realized that there were so many books out there that neither them nor me were really interested in going back on our readings. However, it's also true that people forget plots, forget stories, even book titles they've actually read.

I guess you've heard or even believed that 'reading books make us better people' and phrases like those but if you pay attention to reading conducts across people they vary wildly from people who read classics to people who read YA novels or best sellers for a good plot. There are readers of all different kinds and every reason to read is valid but if what we want is to make the most out of our reading and learn about them and even become better people perhaps we should pay attention to the way in which we read. 

I don't know if this resounds in other people here but I was an evangelical Christian and I remember very well that they always encouraged reading the scriptures again and again, even the same passages (if you think about it churches like these they are like a book club that only reads one book) and the reasoning was something like: The Holy Spirit will enlighten your understanding and He will speak to you through it. Actually what happened was better described in philosophy, for instance by Kant when he talks about the subject and the object. We talk about a subject and an object but the object (the story) exists in relation to the subject (apart from its existence as an object in itself) so what we perceive is the relation to ourselves. When we read a book we do it from a perspective which is made up of our experiences, our previous knowledge, our current emotions, etc. and that's what we apply when we read a book or watch a movie because we experience objects through our subjectivity. So when we read a book when we are 12 or even in the past year it's not just a possible new experience, it's DEFINITELY a new experience. It's not just an experience, though. You can learn from a reread because you're not just ""reading"" you are reviewing yourself while you appropiate this foreign object: the story.

This becomes even more important in my view because currently reading many books is an encouraged achievement. (Think about Goodreads and booktubers and their ""hauls""). It's true, there's a lot of really cool stuff out there yet to be read but there's a huge pressure over readers to consume books as a product. All in all, this is an industry and not a small one.  Also many of us have books in our shelves that are gathering dust and are left completely forgotten. I've had the chance to see some initiatives to share books that people don't read anymore. 

In my presumably pretentious view there are at least two ways to read a book and they also depend on the book you're reading. One of them is experiencing the plot. The other one would be a slow read where you take care of the characters, the plot, the author's biography but also what relates to you. As I said it depends on the book, so for instance, when I'm reading a book I believe has some complexity I take notes and pay more attention. Other books I just read for fun. Still I think that good literature, even in 'lighter stories' should support a second read and even better if they deserve a deeper interpretation. based on what I said above, interpretation (maybe because of my upbringing) doesn't just mean getting to the author's intention but also feeling free to apply it to my own life if I find a pattern that I find useful or at least interesting to keep thinking about and that happens when I read more carefully. 

I'm aware of this [column on The Guardian against rereading](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/jul/03/whyrereadingisacrime) and the people who use rereading to brag about their culture but it's not this what I mean. What I do believe is that we can read a book more than once and have a meaningful experience that even goes beyond knowing the ending. Loving books doesn't mean being subjected to the novelty and adding up titles.

First of all, I get that *Heart of Darkness* was intended as a work of literary impressionism, but I feel like the use of metaphors and vagueness just gets redundant at some point. Nearly every paragraph is littered with a surplus of metaphors (those involving the word 'darkness,' especially) that distracts from the essential plot– speaking of which, I cannot tell if this work is genuinely supposed to be reminding us of the tragedies of European imperialism in the Congo or explaining to us the disgust Conrad felt upon seeing all that *savagery* and *demoralization.*


Given, I am enjoying the stylistic choice of having Marlow's voice bleed together with Conrad's, but at the same time, it confuses me as to whether Conrad was racist or not, considering Marlow is constantly remarking on the Congoleses' animalistic, beast-like qualities... And yes, I do understand that this novel was published in 1899, but it's main function was an attempt to target darkness in the hearts of the imperialists, not to demonize the Congolese.

&gt; Stand in the desert . . . Near them, on the sand,

&gt; Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

&gt; And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,

&gt; Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

&gt; **The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:**

&gt; The lone and level sands stretch far away.”

i love this sonnet but i've never been able to make much sense of *the hand that mocked them* or *the heart that fed.*

the absence of a verb leads me to think that these items are in apposition to something previously mentioned ... either the *passions* of the erstwhile pharaoh that the sculptor artfully captured or the *lifeless things*, which is more enigmatic to me.

the *passions* are the frown, lip, and sneer mentioned above (also the demonstrative *those* as opposed to *these* leads me to believe that it's referring to something above, not below), so let's rule that out.

so the *hand that mocked them* and *the heart that fed* are, i guess, the lifeless things--the lifeless body parts of the colossus? but here is where i cannot follow. egyptian statues have hands, sure, but not hearts (they are not anatomical models).

and what does it mean for a heart to *feed*? on what? worship?

and the big question is: *whom* is the hand mocking?--what is the pronoun *them* referring to in *mocked them*? the passions?

i am wondering whether *mock* here has the meaning of creating a piece of art (like a mock-up), and so i'm wondering if the hands and heart are actually those of the sculptor, not those of the statue OR the portrayed pharaoh. but i am really at a loss. thoughts?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

WOW. First, the multilayered metaphor that DFW employs. We start footnote 110 with a discussion of the inability of Americans to parse information. This leads to a discussion between Hal and Orin speculating on the nature of Quebecois insurgency. But there is a psychological tone being built between them, between youngest and eldest, one of denial on the eldest's part and refusal to understand by the youngest. Trauma, on both sides, dysfunction, etc. 

This, on some level, starts to build a parallel with ONAN-Quebecois relations, and the ability for an individual part to both represent larger frustration within the whole (Hal's deterioration mentally speaking, Orin's denial of base frustrations, with another et cetera for the sake of brevity).

But the beauty here is the contrast between Orin and Hals relations and those of Hal and Mario, who is beginning to be painted as a Mishkin-esque character. Martyrdom as seen from Hal could be a reason for him projecting the rationale for the Quebecois insurgence's irrational behavior. And this is all very moving to consider, the magnitude of the respect that Hal has for his deformed, arachnid brother.

But, the real beauty here is the use of structure to create a larger metaphor, and a richer dynamic between characters. Reading this I was first reminded of Gass's *The Tunnel* in terms of complexity of symbol building and use of character as object within larger story structures, and then it was Foucault's *Preface to Transgression*, and the discussion of creating positivity from the abject and vile. While DFW's execution is not perfect, you have to respect the complexity of his plot structures and how well it all comes together. 

Just kind of rambling since 12 hours have passed and I'm still blown away/","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading the section between pages 306 and 321 of Infinite Jest. WOW. First, the multilayered metaphor that DFW employs. We start footnote 110 with a discussion of the inability of Americans to parse information. This leads to a discussion between Hal and Orin speculating on the nature of Quebecois insurgency. But there is a psychological tone being built between them, between youngest and eldest, one of denial on the eldest&amp;#39;s part and refusal to understand by the youngest. Trauma, on both sides, dysfunction, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, on some level, starts to build a parallel with ONAN-Quebecois relations, and the ability for an individual part to both represent larger frustration within the whole (Hal&amp;#39;s deterioration mentally speaking, Orin&amp;#39;s denial of base frustrations, with another et cetera for the sake of brevity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the beauty here is the contrast between Orin and Hals relations and those of Hal and Mario, who is beginning to be painted as a Mishkin-esque character. Martyrdom as seen from Hal could be a reason for him projecting the rationale for the Quebecois insurgence&amp;#39;s irrational behavior. And this is all very moving to consider, the magnitude of the respect that Hal has for his deformed, arachnid brother. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Well, something finally happened: I let go and let the text wash over me. I stopped trying to look for meaning in every sentence, accepted that I'm just not on the literary level of James Joyce, and now I'm just along for the ride. With that mindset eventually came the pleasure. I will say there is going to be some minor spoilers coming up. If you haven't read it note that I don't think it's possible to spoil this book but feel free to dip out. 



The moment I can actually mark when I finally started having fun with the book is when Leopold Bloom takes center stage. It's then when I realized how much of a living, breathing book Ulysses is. Stephen Dedalus is a drastically different character than Bloom and being in his head is a vastly different experience. Dedalus is such a pessimist that it's a bit of a drain to start with him. If Ulysses has defeated you I can highly recomment holding on tight next time you make an attempt until you get to Bloom.


One part I really like about Bloom's section is the way he takes note of the smallest things. Walking to a butcher shop he catches an advertisement for a Ginger Ale brand and it describes the Ale as ""Aromatic"". That Aromatic part pops in his head a few more times as he continues his walk. I had to grin because it really *feels* like how our brain works. I actually looked up the ginger ale brand and was surprised to find out that it was a real brand at the time. 

Anyway, I just felt compelled to make a post. I wont lie, I always looked at Ulysses as a sort of literary dragon I had to slay one day. I can't describe how much it means to me that I am *enjoying* my time with the book. I'll also admit that I know I'm missing ninety percent of references, allusions, and allegories.

One of the stories we read recently was ""The Monkey's Paw"" by WW Jacobs. I'd taught it before, but never really thought much about it. As I read it more, I began to realize: There's no magic at all; it's all in their heads. I wanted to discuss with others because I spoke to my principal (a former English teacher) about it and she was absolutely convinced it was magic. The other 8th grade LAL teacher is also convinced there's no magic. I was also surprised when I looked at the Wikipedia article for the story, and it describes it as, ""a supernatural short story,"" but doesn't really go any deeper.

Mr. White is a confusing character for me because he's shown to be realistic, yet also one who's led by chance in inappropriate situations. For example, in the first paragraph, the narrator mentions Mr. White's affinity for leaving the game of chess up to chance, rather than skill. This isn't directly related to the topic at hand, but something I noticed.

My first real piece of evidence for the lack of magic is when Mr. White makes his first wish. The text states: “It moved,” he cried, with a look of horror at the object as it lay on the floor. “As I wished, it
twisted in my hand like a snake.”

Before this, it sounds like he and Sergeant-Major Morris had a long night of drinking whiskey, so I'm already not totally bought into his experience that the monkey's paw twisted in his hand like a snake. My other thought is this: If the author wanted to make it an absolute fact, would the narrator not have said it instead? By revealing this information in the dialogue of Mr. White, a character who has been drinking all night, the validity of his character's experience is put into question.

Throughout the text, Mr. White's son questions how honest Sergeant-Major Morris's character is as he tells tales of his adventures. Mr. and Mrs. White both seem gullible in comparison.

As Mr. White and his son, Herbert, smoke beside a fire that evening, the text states: ""Outside, the wind was higher than ever, and the old man jumped nervously at the sound of a door banging upstairs."" This is important for later.

The next day, as we know, we learn that Herbert had gotten eaten by machinery in the factory we could assume he worked at. Just doing some quick research about labor laws in the UK, it seems that factory deaths were quite common. Although it would have to be a great coincidence that the event happens the day after Mr. White wishes for 200 pounds, it wouldn't be too unlikely that Herbert meets his fate this way. Thus, it's more of a coincidence that the payment was also 200 pounds than it is a coincidence that Herbert was killed in the factory. 

My final discussion point is the fact that after Mr. White wishes for his son to return, none of the characters, nor the readers, ever have confirmation that someone is knocking on the door. Earlier in this response, I quoted a part of the text that states the door on the second floor was knocking in the wind. In this scene, the text states, ""At the foot of the stairs the match went out, and he stopped to light another; and at the same moment a knock sounded on the front door. It was so quiet that it could only be heard downstairs, as
if the one knocking wanted to keep their coming a secret."" Given the knocking of the door on the second floor as described earlier in the text, there's no reason why the same thing can't be happening here. In this scene, the door continues to ""knock,"" but no one ever sees anyone behind the door.

In fact, upon reviewing the text, the narrator never explicitly says that the knocking is coming from the door at all, only that the sound of the knocking is traveling throughout the house:

""A third knock sounded through the house.""
""A loud knock echoed through the house.""
""There was another knock, and another.""
""The knocks came very quickly now echoing through the house""

This leads me to believe in two possibilities: (1) the door really is knocking, but 'tis the wind that's the culprit, or (2) mice, as supported by the following: ""A stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse scurried noisily through the wall."" 

There is yet another event here that I have to attribute to coincidence--the knocking stops when Mr. White makes his final wish. Even this is up to speculation because we don't have 100% certainty that he wishes for his son to go away because the author only writes, ""...at the same moment he found
the monkeys’s paw, and frantically breathed his third and last wish."" He could have wished for the knocking to stop. If mice were causing the knocking, it's possible that the commotion caused by Mr. and Mrs. White were enough to still their travels.

After talking about the book with my friend I kept getting Anton Chigurh's name wrong and kept calling him ""Chernobog"". After I looked up the name I remembered that it was a Slavic deity. I started making connections between the two and eventually I did some research.

Unfortunately, I cannot provide any creditable sources on the information of Chernobog. I can only use what I've seen on mythology websites and Wikipedia.

Chernobog is a Slavic deity, a black god who brings destruction and misfortune. The first connection that can be made to Chigurh is his name. Chigurh and Chernobog are very different, however they both start with ""Ch"" and this was enough to make me mix the names up initially. This is a weak point but it'll come up later. Also, Anton Chigurh, to me and through the research I've done, sounds European at the very least, however I believe it to be more Slavic in origin. Another connection is how they are portrayed: both are, well, evil. They bring destruction and death and misfortune. Sheriff Bell describes a ""true and living prophet of destruction"", which we can assume is Chigurh. Chirgurh can also be seen as a bringer of misfortune. He justifies his killings as the workings of fate, so others' misfortune. Chigurh is the embodiment of evil just like Chernobog. However, we also must look at the context of both characters. Who views them as evil? Like much of ancient mythology, Chernobog and his fellow Slavic deities were recorded by Christians. The Christian historians of the time are not seen as the most trustworthy, as they seem to push their ideologies onto the myths they were recording. In the same way, Chigurh is seen as evil by southern, Texan people, many of who are openly Christian. ""You're just a blasphemer,"" he is told by Carla Jean. So, obviously, they both are seen as evil in terms of the Christian faith. One definite thing can be said about Chernobog: he existed in Slavic mythology. He was real and he affected the culture to some degree, much like Chigurh who directly affects the story.

Now, after very little research I came across something interesting. When I first thought that the small similarity between Chernobog's and Chigurh's names was just a coincidence, I found the ""good counterpart"" to Chernobog: Belobog. It's very interesting how this god who relates to Chigurh shares a similar name to Sheriff Bell, who is Chigurh's ""good counterpart"". Belobog is the white god of Slavic mythology, the god of the light and the Sun. This is what Bell is too in his book: the embodiment of what is good. The interesting thing about Belobog is that he may not have even existed. There are actually no reliable historical sources that mention him at all. He seems to be made up. He's just there to counter the evil Chernobog. This is a big connection to Bell. He doesn't really do anything. He's just there as something to compare Chigurh to. Much like the Sun that Belobog represents, Bell is destined to look upon the world and watch as the shadows engulf it.

Although, this can be taken in a not so pessimistic way. The shadows that engulf the world are natural, not some evil plot to make the world dark. The world has been bathed in sunlight and hidden in shadows since before humans existed, both in the theistic and scientific sense. The world will keep spinning and the darkness and light, the evil and the good, will persist the same way they always have.

What do you think in regards to the connection of Chigurh and Bell to the gods Chernobog and Belobog? I wish I could have actual hard evidence of the gods' personalities and worship in ancient Slavic culture. If you have any additional information regarding the gods or the characters please comment. I would love to discuss.

I just finished reading T.S. Elliot's *The Wasteland*, and I wanted to start a discussion. 

My own thoughts are that this poem is largely an apocalyptic tale of Western Civilization. In a certain sense, we have run our course. We have said all that we need to say, and now we are fragmented and disparate. The lack of any one narrator in the poem is emblematic of the lack of cohesive identity/ideology in Western thought. It is difficult to see the ferocious fighting between different cultural and political sides in the West and not agree on some level with this. 

A big portion of this poem evokes the passing of time and the rise and fall of past great civilizations (Falling towers/ Jerusalem Athens Alexandria/ Vienna London 374-376). All of these cities are former Great Cities emblematic of their cultures with the exception of London, which is a current Great City. However, this list forces us to realize the London is merely next on the list of cities to diminish in glory. Thus, all of the events of the poem take place against the backdrop of this apocalyptic setting. Elliot repeatedly references the ""violet hour"", which can be taken to mean twilight- the end of day for Western Culture. 

The last two parts- IV. Death By Water and V. What the Thunder Said- are interesting to me, because they overlook the ruin of our decaying culture and then look beyond it.

In Death by Water, we have the image of a drowned Phoenician sailor Phlebas. He set out into the sea only to be drowned. The metaphorical resonance should be clear, he left his home- the ideas and culture he inherited from his ancestors- to search for truth on his own in the great void of the unknown (here, the sea). Of course, the void swallows him up and drowns him. Recall in part I. the clairvoyant Madame Sosostris- who presents the card of the drowned sailor with pearls over his eyes. She is described as ""the wisest woman in Europe."" The reason, I believe, is that she understands that the search for Truth inevitably ends in our demise, and that all cultures which rise on the prominence of some insight or way of thinking will eventually decline as well. 
Going back to book IV., Elliot writes ""O you who turn the wheel and look to windward, / Consider Phlebas, who once handsome and / tall as you."" (320-322) This is a warning to never think that somehow we're the ones who have found Truth, or that we're the ones who have everything figured out. Phlebas was just as tall and handsome as we are. 

I read part V. as the aftermath of Western Civilization's decline. There is a lack of water (meaning, the source of life or a lack of what gives life purpose). There are hellish red sweaty faces. No place or time is specified, meaning that this could be anywhere in the world and at any time after the present. Then, rain comes out of the sky saving humanity. Somewhere, and at some time, humanity gets some new inspiration, allowing them to rise and dictate the thinking for a time. 

After all of this, the opening line makes more sense
""April is the cruelest month, breeding / 
lilacs out of the dead land, mixing /
Memory and desire, stirring / 
Dull roots with spring rain...""

April is cruel, in that the new inspiration will eventually fade. We are born into the world only to die. Any new civilization will go out to sea and eventually drown like Phlebas. The arrival at Truth seems to ever elude us. 

What do you think of the poem? Do you read it like I do?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading T.S. Elliot&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Wasteland&lt;/em&gt;, and I wanted to start a discussion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own thoughts are that this poem is largely an apocalyptic tale of Western Civilization. In a certain sense, we have run our course. We have said all that we need to say, and now we are fragmented and disparate. The lack of any one narrator in the poem is emblematic of the lack of cohesive identity/ideology in Western thought. It is difficult to see the ferocious fighting between different cultural and political sides in the West and not agree on some level with this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A big portion of this poem evokes the passing of time and the rise and fall of past great civilizations (Falling towers/ Jerusalem Athens Alexandria/ Vienna London 374-376). All of these cities are former Great Cities emblematic of their cultures with the exception of London, which is a current Great City. However, this list forces us to realize the London is merely next on the list of cities to diminish in glory. Thus, all of the events of the poem take place against the backdrop of this apocalyptic setting. Elliot repeatedly references the &amp;quot;violet hour&amp;quot;, which can be taken to mean twilight- the end of day for Western Culture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last two parts- IV. Death By Water and V. What the Thunder Said- are interesting to me, because they overlook the ruin of our decaying culture and then look beyond it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Death by Water, we have the image of a drowned Phoenician sailor Phlebas. He set out into the sea only to be drowned. The metaphorical resonance should be clear, he left his home- the ideas and culture he inherited from his ancestors- to search for truth on his own in the great void of the unknown (here, the sea). Of course, the void swallows him up and drowns him. Recall in part I. the clairvoyant Madame Sosostris- who presents the card of the drowned sailor with pearls over his eyes. She is described as &amp;quot;the wisest woman in Europe.&amp;quot; The reason, I believe, is that she understands that the search for Truth inevitably ends in our demise, and that all cultures which rise on the prominence of some insight or way of thinking will eventually decline as well. 
Going back to book IV., Elliot writes &amp;quot;O you who turn the wheel and look to windward, / Consider Phlebas, who once handsome and / tall as you.&amp;quot; (320-322) This is a warning to never think that somehow we&amp;#39;re the ones who have found Truth, or that we&amp;#39;re the ones who have everything figured out. Phlebas was just as tall and handsome as we are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read part V. as the aftermath of Western Civilization&amp;#39;s decline. There is a lack of water (meaning, the source of life or a lack of what gives life purpose). There are hellish red sweaty faces. No place or time is specified, meaning that this could be anywhere in the world and at any time after the present. Then, rain comes out of the sky saving humanity. Somewhere, and at some time, humanity gets some new inspiration, allowing them to rise and dictate the thinking for a time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all of this, the opening line makes more sense
&amp;quot;April is the cruelest month, breeding / 
lilacs out of the dead land, mixing /
Memory and desire, stirring / 
Dull roots with spring rain...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;April is cruel, in that the new inspiration will eventually fade. We are born into the world only to die. Any new civilization will go out to sea and eventually drown like Phlebas. The arrival at Truth seems to ever elude us. &lt;/p&gt;

I've been reading it and for me it's one of the most beautiful plays, one of the most difficult works of art that Shakespeare has created. I see Shakespeare doing a lot of new things, mixing tragedy and romance, showing us an almost causeless sexual jealousy in the character of Leontes (Harold Bloom calls him an Othello who is his own Iago), who seems to me one of the most psychologically fascinating of Shakespeare's characters.

Here's a great passage spoken by Leontes:

&gt;Is whispering nothing?        
&gt;Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?   
&gt;Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career   
&gt;Of laughing with a sigh?—a note infallible   
&gt;Of breaking honesty—horsing foot on foot?   
&gt;Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?   
&gt;Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes   
&gt;Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,   
&gt;That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?    
&gt;Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;   
&gt;The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;   
&gt;My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,   
&gt;If this be nothing.   

And of course one of my favorite, one of the most shocking images ever created by Shakespeare:

&gt;There may be in the cup           
&gt;A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,   
&gt;And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge     
&gt;Is not infected: but if one present   
&gt;The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known

Krasznahorkai goes from strength to strength or, rather, finds his best form again after what I thought was a dip with *The Last Wolf*. Like *Seiobo There Below*, his new book consists of short chapters connected by common themes. Unlike the earlier book, which had a strong sense of being an episodic novel with narrative drive and development throughout (albeit spiralling in on itself rather than moving forward in a linear way), *TWGO* seems to me on first reading like a collection of stories, although the connecting themes are as strong as before. This might be because some chapters aren't really narratives at all but short abstract pieces drawing us into his nihilistic philosophy and his irresistible view of the precarious tragedy of the human condition (the most gripping articulation of this is in his little collaborative book *Animalinside*). Then in the next chapter he'll be back to storytelling and the familiar self-deprecating dry humour  -- he's once again as funny and heart breaking as Buster Keaton in a play by Beckett. The chapter form makes it a less forbidding prospect than the single sentence ""rivers of black ink"" of his earlier books at any rate.

Several chapters reflect on things he has written before, such as when he returns to Nietszche's final revelation and the beaten horse, subject of his screenplay for Tarr's film *The Turin Horse*. It's also true of the centrepiece ~~title~~ story *The Universal Theseus*, which must be one of the best things he has written -- a (properly) Kafkaesque tale told in the first person present in which a man has been summoned, out of the blue, to give a series of lectures. He has no idea why he has been asked to do it, what the audience want from him, or on what subject he should speak. A good half of each lecture is given over to explaining why he's not the man for the job, the least suitable person imaginable in fact. This is K. speaking drily about his vocation as a writer of difficult, futile books that are lost on their audience (they certainly connect with me but you can't help believing he sincerely thinks that, at this stage). What with his preoccupation with Nietszche's ""Mutter, Ich bin dumm"" and his mate Tarr's retirement from film, this story has me seriously worried that he might stop writing. When Tarr announced his retirement I was really disappointed but then I saw the film and thought ""well, you've said the lot there. If you really feel that way, and you clearly do, then I don't blame you for not making any more."" This story has the same valedictory feel, but who knows. Maybe making so much of the futility of speaking is more of his ironic, paradoxical philosophy.   (EDIT apparently this story was written decades ago, so I'd say it's panic over :))

In the thread about this book coming out someone mentioned the quote from Sontag comparing him to Gogol and Melville that his publishers never leave off the jacket, questioning how meaningful it is -- I think both comparisons shed some light on his strengths. ~~Maybe the comparison with Gogol is based on the similarities between *Satantango* (it must have been that book Sontag was talking about) and *Dead Souls*, both pessimistic and resigned farces set amongst the serfs.~~(Corrected on this by u/Apfelwurmloch, see below!) A stylistic comparison with Melville is in order too, in the relentless OCD *Grosse Fuge* pursuit of ideas where you don't know if he's determined to weave them into new sense or unravel them til no sense is left. 

Looking forward to hearing what you think.

In regards to this written verse:

**.*I want to unfold.*.**

**.*I don’t want to be folded anywhere*,**

**.*because where I am folded*,**

**.*there I am a lie.*.**

-R.M.Rilke

Lately, I keep going back to this poem because when seeing the word ‘fold’ I see its Spanish equivalent, *doblar*.  And this literally translates to ‘double’.   

So, I’m wondering if this verse has anything to do with a confrontation of sorts. Specifically between our own dual nature.  Being ‘folded’ to me sounds like being enslaved or trapped within a self-imposed prison. Like being forced to live a lie, but because of fear. 

**Does  anyone have any insight on this author’s intended meaning?**

The thing that comes to mind (for me) is the traditional dance named *El Paso Doble* or in the ballet (French language), *pas de deux*.  This well known piece of choreography depicts two dueling personas that climax by finally forming *something new*.  A transformation of sorts.  The uniting of opposites creates a new pose or style but only after intense passionate struggle, then finally submission.  

My thoughts are that it is about facing our ‘darkside’, rather a side to our soul that must be confronted, forgiven and accepted. **First there is a fight, then a reconciliation, and finally complete and total surrender (unfolding)**. A way I suppose of accepting change. Only first we have to actually ‘let go’ of our tightly held beliefs?   Or rigid ‘position’?

Rilke’s words echo my own profound longing towards a way for Divine Union. 


Makes me wonder  if this DREAM/DESIRE  of what the mystics refer to as *differentiated union* is even possible.  The type of union that wouldn’t  necessarily eliminate one side or the other - but could maintain both natures intact.   *Creating* a completely new expression of existence with a simple act of trust or blind faith. 

Do you think this is what the words mean?    Thank you for any insight. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if this is the correct forum for my question, so I deeply apologize if this is irregular.   In regards to this written verse:&lt;/p&gt;

Reading his work, it's easy to see why people think that. However, it's baffling from a statistical perspective.

EL as we know it today began, roughly speaking, with Geoffrey Chaucer (I'm sure that's a simplification, but it got us through A-level). If we ask what fraction of the authors since then predate Shakespeare, it has to be hardly any, because it's a fraction of the post-Chaucer history, and because since then the world population, fraction of it speaking English, and fraction of Anglophones who were literate have all skyrocketed.  If all would-be-Greatest-Writer candidates had the same chance, it'd almost certainly be someone much more recent than the Bard.

But actually, early people were at two further disadvantages: the small market for their work was less of an incentive in an era when literacy was a path to other great jobs, and they had fewer giants' shoulders to stand on. The obvious advantage Shakespeare's successors had over him was that they could draw inspiration from his past work.

So given these facts, why hasn't anyone been able to dislodge Shakespeare, or at least make ""he's the best"" a more contentious standpoint? I'll offer my thoughts because r/literature discussions require the OP to do that, but I'm sure other people here will have much better ideas than mine (that's why I'm asking).

When we call writers great, we're often talking about influence as much as or more than the ""quality"" (whatever that is) of their writing. When you're the ultimately most influential author from an early era, with very few contemporaries compared to the writing pool of today, you could easily have more reach than anyone thereafter. Unless everyone for the next century starts reshaping their writing style to learn from J K Rowling, his influence will be hard to beat.

Or maybe he's the permanent pinnacle because he invented or reinvented so many different genres in his plays. (I remember one Reddit post explaining that what made him so great is that he mastered or even created so many different kinds of play.) In an era when there weren't that many examples of each to learn from, doing something innovative with each of them was a lot more achievable than it would be today, when our best living writers may manage that in one or two genres at best.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Shakespeare is widely regarded as the single greatest writer in the history of English literature.

I think Serbian literature isn't so known, so I would like to recommend you some authors, but I am not sure their work is translated.
Probably the most famous Serbian writer is a Nobel laureate, Ivo Andric. He lived in XIX century, so mainly he was a realist, but his work included various themes - mainly life of Serbs under Turkish reign in Bosnia.
My personal favourite is Milos Crnjanski, poet, novelist... He wrote so many masterpieces - both poems and novels. I highly recommend a poem ""Lament nad Beogradom"" and a novel ""Seobe"".
Another great realist was Laza Lazarevic. Although he wrote few stories (9), he is a very important piece in history of Serbian literature. I would recommend all his stories, but my favourites are ""Prvi put s ocem na jutrenje"" and ""Na bunaru"".
If you love theatre, the obvious choice is Branislav Nusic. He mainly wrote comedies. His most famous plays include ""Gospodja ministarka"", ""Sumnjivo lice"", ""Vlast""...
If you are, however, in the mood for love poetry, I recommend Jovan Jovanovic Zmaj. Even though he wrote satire poems, he remains best known for his love poetry. His poems published in book ""Djulici"" tell the story about love, happiness, heaven on earth, but when his wife and children die, he writes ""Djulici uveoci"", a tragic story about losing everything valuable.
On the other side, if you are a history lover, read anything from Petar Petrovic Njegos. He was a Montenegrin ruler and bishop, but he identified as Serb and his ""Gorski vijenac"" is arguably the most Serbian thing ever written.
Another nominee for Nobel Prize was Milorad Pavic, famous for his ""Hazarski recnik"" and controversial death. Another one great book is ""Predeo slikan cajem"", a story about Serbian monastery on Athos, Hilandar.
Famous among Serbs and often quoted is also Mesa Selimovic. I recommend ""Tvrdjava"".
Bora Stankovic is one of my favourite writers, not just from Serbia. His famous play ""Kostana"" is still often played across Serbia. He was not so accepted in his time, mainly because he used a dialect, instead of standard language, but he very successfully captured a picture of oriental Vranje, town in Southern Serbia, where Turkish tradition is still recognisable. Check out ""Necista krv"", ""Uvela ruza"", ""U noci"".
Of course, the list doesn't stop here. I haven't mentioned Desanka Maksimovic, Branko Radicevic, Dobrica Cosic, Vasko Popa... I just wanted to spread some informations about Serbian literature, because I think it's not quite popular and people outside of Balkan are not so familiar with it.
Note 1: I referred to some controversial writers, such as Ivo Andric. There is a debate whether he is from Croatia or Serbia, but I don't think it's important, because he wrote in Serbian (Croatian), and there is almost no difference at all between these languages.
Note 2: English is not my native language, so pardon my language mistakes.
If you are not from Serbia/Balkan and you are familiar with any of those writers, I would like to know who you heard of them.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I am from Serbia and today I was thinking about literature in general.

His poems published in book &amp;quot;Djulici&amp;quot; tell the story about love, happiness, heaven on earth, but when his wife and children die, he writes &amp;quot;Djulici uveoci&amp;quot;, a tragic story about losing everything valuable.
On the other side, if you are a history lover, read anything from Petar Petrovic Njegos. He was a Montenegrin ruler and bishop, but he identified as Serb and his &amp;quot;Gorski vijenac&amp;quot; is arguably the most Serbian thing ever written.
Another nominee for Nobel Prize was Milorad Pavic, famous for his &amp;quot;Hazarski recnik&amp;quot; and controversial death. Another one great book is &amp;quot;Predeo slikan cajem&amp;quot;, a story about Serbian monastery on Athos, Hilandar.
Famous among Serbs and often quoted is also Mesa Selimovic. I recommend &amp;quot;Tvrdjava&amp;quot;.
Bora Stankovic is one of my favourite writers, not just from Serbia. His famous play &amp;quot;Kostana&amp;quot; is still often played across Serbia. He was not so accepted in his time, mainly because he used a dialect, instead of standard language, but he very successfully captured a picture of oriental Vranje, town in Southern Serbia, where Turkish tradition is still recognisable. Check out &amp;quot;Necista krv&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Uvela ruza&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;U noci&amp;quot;.
Of course, the list doesn&amp;#39;t stop here. I haven&amp;#39;t mentioned Desanka Maksimovic, Branko Radicevic, Dobrica Cosic, Vasko Popa... I just wanted to spread some informations about Serbian literature, because I think it&amp;#39;s not quite popular and people outside of Balkan are not so familiar with it.
Note 1: I referred to some controversial writers, such as Ivo Andric. There is a debate whether he is from Croatia or Serbia, but I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s important, because he wrote in Serbian (Croatian), and there is almost no difference at all between these languages.
Note 2: English is not my native language, so pardon my language mistakes.
If you are not from Serbia/Balkan and you are familiar with any of those writers, I would like to know who you heard of them.&lt;/p&gt;

The poem is separated into three parts and a footnote, each of which with its own refrain.

Part I is a massive run on sentence coming back to the word ""who"" before describing the exploits of people known to the author (and no doubt some of his own) who have been ""destroyed by madness"" of some form or another. After a provocative first line this part really dragged on for me. I almost stopped after a few lines because I thought I would hate this poem, but I'm glad I stuck with it. 

After describing various soul destroying experiences for the promising youths Ginsberg knew in Part I, Part II names the cause of this suffering, Moloch, the god of the canaanites who demanded child sacrifice, also a stand in for industrialized American life in the 1950s. I really enjoyed the imagery in this section, painting pictures of a malevolent god in the facades of urban skyscrapers. At this point I felt like I made the right choice by sticking with this poem.

Ginsberg goes on to recall his relationship with Carl Solomon in Part III. Subject to electroshock therapy in a mental institution referred to a ""Rockwell"", Solomon exemplifies the sacrificial lamb at the center of this poem. It's pretty sad to think about how many others fell victim to treatment methods like that.

I had my doubts that Christmas committed the murder almost from the beginning, considering Brown is found shitfaced in the burning home and is later caught in a lie when he gives his statement to the Sheriff. But most discussions and synopses I see online seem to unquestioningly accept that Christmas is guilty.

Christmas is shown to be violent elsewhere, and there's circumstantial evidence that can support the idea that he kills Joanna, but the same can be said of Brown. Seems to me that it's intentionally ambiguous, so I find it a little curious that so many people state as fact that Christmas commits the murder.

A very interesting novel that raises many questions.

I know it&amp;#39;s not important for the story, but there are some contradictions I feel would be solved if I got a better grip on this thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, the narrator (N) is 22 if I recall correctly, in college. He gets to New York and &lt;a href=""/spoiler""&gt;the paint factory&lt;/a&gt; within the same year, that much I know. But then it starts getting hazy. From the day he gets spotted by Brother Jack, during &lt;a href=""/spoiler""&gt;the eviction of the old black couple,&lt;/a&gt; to the very end of the &amp;quot;Brotherhood&amp;quot; arc (ending in the &lt;a href=""/spoiler""&gt;Harlem race riot),&lt;/a&gt; how much does N age? It doesn&amp;#39;t feel reasonable that N, having &lt;a href=""/spoiler""&gt;risen to becoming a prominent civil rights leader and a political star, as well as a momentary pick-up artist of the roughly 45-year old wife of one of the Brotherhood committee members,&lt;/a&gt; should be just a 22-year old dude. For how long is N actively connected to &lt;a href=""/spoiler""&gt;The Brotherhood?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Life of Pi is my favorite novel written by a living writer. It always gives me a strange feeling that the author did not talk aloud his true purpose in the story. I searched on wiki about his own statement on this book, but I can not believe Mr. Martel’s ""Life is a story...” thing, it’s too obvious and too simple. Of course that’s true, Mr. Martel gave readers a tiny and insignificant part of the truth and hid the rest in his pocket and sniggered.

  I think Life of Pi is a story about religion, not to lead people to Believe any religion, but to lead people to Know religions. This book is an allegory, Mr. Martel, like Aesop, plays humans story by animals. 
There are two kind of people link to a religion—believers and instructors. 

  What the believers want from religion is food for their spirit’s hunger and shelters to protect them from the torture of life. They caged their real nature (lust, greed and of course reason or rationality) in religion to get the ease of mind. But sometimes life is too rough, even the cage of religion won’t hold tight and releases Reason which like a tiger would devour the believer. Through all the adventure on the sea, Pi tries to tame his reason. He seemingly succeeds and gets some kind of peace with the tiger. But he does not. Reason is too strong and powerful to be shaped to any other form. When he finally reaches shore, he has to sever himself in two and abandons his reason to move on with his trauma, that causes great pain. We get two stories from Pi and know clearly that at least one of them is lie. Most people don’t believe the first one, lots of people don’t even believe both. While digging the true story from the lie, we are digging ugly truth under the beautiful cover of religions. So what is religion? When one is enjoying a peaceful and plenteous life, religion is about beauty, Meditation and fun; while in suffer, religion would become refuge and medicine for someone and this is a dose cost dearly. Though religions have beautiful appearance and healing power, they are nothing but lies. When you choose one of them, you choose to abandon your reason and truth. There is no judge of right and wrong, just mere choice. Pi is every religious believer. They are true believers without hypocrisy, enjoy and suffer for their religion, they are all Pi----the irrational numbers.

And who are the instructors? And why do they do this? These are very interesting questions and not very difficult to find out answer from the book though irrelevant to this book. One could be both Believer and Instructor. Or just one of them. That is also interesting.

  There is a large chance that I stretched too far. But it is a character of a good book which induces different thinking. I am very curious about Mr. Martel’s response but it’s shame I have no access to his twitter or facebook. 

Again, there is not negative meaning about Irrational.

The whole book made me think about everything, all the 'what ifs' that could turn our beautiful and warm earth into a cold and desolate world. The book was well written and it made the atmosphere more realistic and really portrayed how a barren, lifeless world could look like.

At first, when reading the book, I absolutely detested Cormac's writing style but ended up liking it once I got used to it and realizing that it had an impact to the whole reading experience.

While the book has a third-person limited narrator, I couldn't help but notice that one section was written in a first-person narration (Section 135 page 65) and since the boy plays a significant role (with the whole good guys vs. bad guys), and since I want to study English Literature, it got me thinking. How would the novel be different if it were told as a first-person story by the boy?

Personally, I would not have enjoyed it since I don't like first-person narrations but that's just me. The story wouldn't have been that detailed and immersive  if told in such a way.

What are your opinion on my question?

Tl;Dr :  In the book ""The Road"" by Cormac McCarthy, what effect does the point of view have on you and how would the novel be different if it were told as a first-person story by the boy, for example?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as stated in the title, I have just finished &amp;quot;The Road&amp;quot; by Cormac McCarthy and I need to talk about it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole book made me think about everything, all the &amp;#39;what ifs&amp;#39; that could turn our beautiful and warm earth into a cold and desolate world. The book was well written and it made the atmosphere more realistic and really portrayed how a barren, lifeless world could look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, when reading the book, I absolutely detested Cormac&amp;#39;s writing style but ended up liking it once I got used to it and realizing that it had an impact to the whole reading experience.&lt;/p&gt;

So I'm reading Völuspá for Icelandic literature class and I came across something that i felt like I've heard before.

English [here](http://www.voluspa.org/voluspa16-20.htm). ( In my opinion, I think the translation is a bit off)

Óðinn and his brothers, Hænir and Lóður, give a couple of washed up trees by the shore, soul, blood/vigor, sense/wisdom, and a colorful hue. There, Askur and Embla were made. They're essentially the Norse version of Adam and Eve. 

I just found it very interesting how the three characters in Oz (lion, tinman, and scarecrow) are pretty much given those same traits that they're missing in the beginning.

I have a few observations and questions...

I had always thought 1984 was specifically about communism, much like Animal Farm; but it seemed to be about the dangers of any authoritarian government, almost regardless of political ideology because, as it's states several times: those in power only want more power.

Winston was a *miserable* person at the start of the novel, and this never really changes. Was his miserable contempt for everything at the begging of the story a symptom of the totalitarian society? Was Orwell saying that simply living under such a society made people innately terrible?

This leads into my thought at the end of the novel: O'Brien's speech and monologues during the interrogation seemed reminiscent of Winston's attitudes at the beginning; contempt for everything, a superiority complex... as though if you had given Winston the same absolute power, he would have been a spitting image of O'Brien. Am I reading too much into that?

Why was there such a focus on NewSpeak as a mechanic of the Party throughout the book, when it didn't seem to pay off? I understood the Party's goal of NewSpeak and how it would be used to control the population, but Orwell went into length to explain it, and even included a whole section after the novel ended about how it works.  It never seems to actually do anything within the plot other than serve as another decoration of the evil Party.

The Goldstein Manifesto book Winston and Julia are given seems to be the soapbox Orwell uses to describe the methods of authoritarian regimes. ""Reader! Forget the plot of the book. Look around you and watch out for these things in real life!"" But then, back into the context of the plot, the whole thing was a ruse used by the Party itself, so I was unsure of what to make of it.

The twist, I thought, wasn't so much that O'Brien was a double agent, but that the foundations of Winston's fears of the Party weren't accurate. I got the impression that people that were disappeared weren't really ever executed; everyone in the Outer Party would by design either try to rebel on their own accords, or be coerced into rebellion by O'Brien - and then from there be broken and brainwashed over however long to be reintroduced into society as a Party-loving shell of their former selves.

What struck me as the most odd was that Winston never seemed to love Julia. I suppose he was fond of her, but their encounters really ever only seemed to be described as an escape, and served as their personal rebellion against the Party. So when Winston was finally broken and betrayed Julia, it didn't seem to have the emotional impact I think it intended to.

It was a good read, I both wish I had read it sooner and glad I held off. There are a lot of things in the novel that show up in popular culture that I had an idea they came from 1984, but now I have a better understanding of those references. Anyway, if anyone has any feedback to my questions or comments, I would appreciate it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a good and easy read, not at all what I expected.

I personally love reading these short stories which are really specific on few topics so it is easier to catch details and finish in one read which makes it more impactful. I can't make a review out of this since this book felt just like a map to me. Navigates me and shows but nothing more. I didn't expect anything more honestly, although i really saw the power of Zweig's writing since he was more of a philosopher side of the writers in my mind.
I want to start by saying that i thought this book was about obsession for a really long time, i thought it showed a lot of details about why and how it started. Then i really felt the woman actually loved the guy after her disregard for her own life for a man he never spoke but actually knows much more about him even than the guy himself. 
Really after this book and thinking about it it kinda changed my view on love since i always thought love was correlated with friendship and respect and physical attributes are much less in to what happens when we define love. But now i think of it, maybe love just happens, randomly, like most of the natural phenomenons. Maybe neither physical or spiritual aspect of relationship has no role in it. Maybe these only make love easy.

Also, book was sort of about obsession too since can you really love someone for like your whole life without having anything in return. Like is that even possible, biologically or physically.  I find it rather hard to correlate obsession and love since one is good for you and the other is bad. I think Zweig had different impression on love and showed love more like a drug, that you skip even your whole life just to have a bid more. 

As you could see I got really confused on this the thought of mine and i know the answer to these question on love are subjective but is really love an obsession? Is it bad for you? Since i always thought love is one of the few things that makes life worthwhile. Maybe it is different when you love the person you find attractive and such?

Nicole may have had her troubles and she did indeed capture him- however once her's, she revered him and was good and true. I suppose he craved more in life as evident in his youthful boasting to be “the best physiologist in the world”. Yet Nicole hardly sat in the way- in fact she enabled him. Her money was freedom and not a trap. He had a clinic he was in charge with plenty of trial cases to build his theses for whatever book he would choose. Yet he framed it as a cage.

Yet one secret of happiness seems to be making other people happy-to make the other person happy.

I read ""Never Let Me Go"" by Kazuo Ishiguro because he just won the Nobel, and this is one of his more renowned works...

Am I the only one this fell flat for?

The main characters felt completely flat to me, and they never seemed to grow from there 'highschool' cliquey-ness. Kathy didn't have much  initiative throughout the story, she was such a passive narrator. Additionally, every single character seemed to be irredeemably gullible and naive. Even the adults who were normal felt unbearably flat and cliche. 

I couldn't believe we didn't hear about an ounce of dissention in the novel. Are we meant to believe every single one of the characters just accepts their God awful fate?

The first half of the book is spent in this shroud of mystery that never has a curtain pull, instead it just sort of evaporates and feels incredibly anticlimactic. The **whole** book is building up a romance that only sees the light of day in the last 30 pages, which is so completely passionless and lackluster. Thematically this book was boring as well. It never hammered home what exactly it wanted to, perhaps it was about fate, maybe about the willful aversion to truth in order to live more a comfortable life; in any regard— it fails to be compelling. 

What am I meant to get out of this book? Is this really Nobel worthy work? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read &amp;quot;Never Let Me Go&amp;quot; by Kazuo Ishiguro because he just won the Nobel, and this is one of his more renowned works...&lt;/p&gt;

The collateral question was: what should we make of the novels written by authors who turned out to be rather terrible people?

Those are actually quite valid questions and it's unfortunate OP deleted it. I imagine the initially low karma count of his post made him second guess the relevance of his post. But it got me thinking about Roland Barthes' [Death of the Author](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author).

It's a wonderfully challenging and interesting theory because it asks how closely you should read a novel and question the very nature of the writing process. I hope more fellow redditers will give us their take on it. So below are some thoughts I had gathered for OP on the now seminal question: can you and should you separate the book and the writer?

""I don't think you can entirely separate the author from his work. Mainly because of the very nature of the writing process.

One remark that echoes from one writer to the next (and you can see that in the [Art of Fiction](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/tag/art-of-fiction/) series of the *Paris Review*) is that writing begins when you have something compelling to say. That, by nature, requires the subject of the book to attach to the author somewhere. For example, see this quote extracted from the First lecture in *Sesame and Lillies* by John Ruskin:

&gt;But a book is written, not to multiply the voice merely, not to carry it merely, but to perpetuate it. The author has something to say which he perceives to be true and useful, or helpfully beautiful. So far as he knows, no one has yet said it; so far as he knows, no one else can say it. He is bound to say it, clearly and melodiously if he may; clearly at all events. In the sum of his life he finds this to be the thing, or group of things, manifest to him;—this, the piece of true knowledge, or sight, which his share of sunshine and earth has permitted him to seize. He would fain set it down for ever; engrave it on rock, if he could; saying, ""This is the best of me; for the rest, I ate, and drank, and slept, loved, and hated, like another; my life was as the vapour, and is not; but this I saw and knew: this, if anything of mine, is worth your memory."" That is his ""writing;"" it is, in his small human way, and with whatever degree of true inspiration is in him, his inscription, or scripture. That is a ""Book.""

Besides, some authors write with a specific intent. This will bend the narrative arc, shape characters and condition the prose in manners that will be conducive to the effect the writer is after.

Finally, trying to separate the writer from his work obfuscates the therapeutic nature of writing. Consciously or subconciously, writers will work out their neuroses through the pen. A rather extreme example would be Kafka whose abusive father is the subtext of almost all his work. An other, more contemporary, more watered down example is Danish screenwriter Søren Sveistrup who put it this way:

&gt;[The screenplay] has to do with some personal experience I had many years back, and really I'm just re-writing my own neurosis with every episode. ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/dec/01/the-killing-iii-episodes-five-six))

 These sorts of unresolved conflicts break out into a story more sporadically for other authors.

JK Rowling was mentionned elsewhere in this thread. I don't remember if she's the one who explained it but there is, for instance, a clear metaphor of depression in Dementors: something dark that brings back your worst memories, for which the only salvation is holding on hard to the rememberance of your happiest moment and for which the only comfort is chocolate... (See also [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQE7AWiFo9s) interview with Karl Ove Knausgaard where he explains why his first novel was inadvertently about his father).

So you can't really separate the author and his book. That being said, it doesn't mean that *all* of the author goes into the book. The best examples of this are the French Céline and the Norwegian Knut Hamsun. Both (enthusiastic) nazi sympathizers. Both exquisite writers. I know Céline has spaced out racist flares in those works of his that aren't propaganda. I haven't ventured far enough into Hamsun to know that yet, but I presume it's the same. Nonetheless, what matters is that both express a true understanding of human suffering in their respective work and display an awesome poetic power. Reading their legitimate work, you wouldn't know they cheered Hitler.

So that's how you work it out. The book you read is a part of the author, but a part only. Which can be in stark contrast or complete contradiction with the rest of the persona. And it's good and right that it should be so. We're all complicated. Our good writers should be a notch more complex. Because it's in the folds of the human equation that the interesting truths are hidden.

Peace. Read on.""

I am planning a gift for a birth and thought this quote might be appropriate to include. But, before I do, I wanted to make certain I'm taking the appropriate meaning from the quote. 

In act 2 scene 1 of Much Ado About Nothing, Don Pedro makes a comment about Beatrice's birth, that it must have been a ""happy hour."" In response, Beatrice says:
""No, sure, my lord, my mother cried, but then there was a
star danced, and under that was I born...""

Just making sure I'm understanding this line as it is meant to be understood. Beatrice means that her mother suffered great pain in her birth, as folks often do, but it wasn't in that moment of pain that she was truly born but rather under separate yet adjacent moment beneath a dancing star, a time of celebration. She's saying that in the precise moment of her birth was a painful one for her mother but she was happy because Beatrice had arrived, and that moment of happiness marked her true birth, right? Like how when mothers recall the births of their children they don't remember the pain as much as they remember the joy of meeting their child for the first time. 

What do you all think? Am I completely off base? I'd love to hear your opinions or other interpretations of the line.

I posted my thoughts on The Brothers Karamazov yesterday and am welcoming all discussion.**

I've been mulling over The Brothers Karamazov for the past couple days, and I can't quite formulate a concrete opinion on it yet. Generally speaking, I'd like to hear why others have considered it as ""the greatest novel of all time,"" as I so often see. Personally, as an atheist (which may or may not be necessary to qualify this with) I felt that most of the novel was utilized as Dostoevsky's soap box for espousing his philosophy of existential faith--that is, humans will be humans, but at the end of the day, faith is God is important for good character. Perhaps this is a fair bit derivative considering the vastness of the book, but it's what has troubled me most in my post-Karamazov mind.

I felt a little cheated, in total, as his morally complex characters are set up all with separate philosophies on life, and rather than treat each respectfully, it's painfully clear that Alyosha is meant to be the model behavior humanity should follow. Of course, he is by no means perfect, but he is the one character who doesn't suffer significantly due to his actions and beliefs. In contrast, Fyodor the materialist has no chance for redemption (and perhaps fitfully so). Dmitri is the most overt, exaggerated example of the Karamazov walking-contradiction, who's negative tendencies land him caught up and prosecuted in the trial. Smerdyakov kills himself for his acceptance of the ideal that ""everything is permitted."" Lise is criminally tossed aside, initially set up as a potential love interest for Alyosha, but then corrupted (by Ivan's philosophy?) and the last action she takes in the novel is purporting to send a letter which offers herself to Ivan and crushing her fingers in her door as she bemoans how wretched she is.

Perhaps most unjustly treated in the novel is Ivan, who literally suffers a brain fever and goes nearly mad hallucinating who he believes is Satan (or the personification of his ideas as Satanic), abruptly putting an end to his atheistic and intellectual philosophizing. This is so unsatisfying to me, because the Grand Inquisitor speech which sparks so much debate about the role of religion and God in a world ruled by human freedom is undercut--narratively speaking--by the fate of Ivan and his immense suffering and ""redemption"" arc. It's important for Dostoevsky that Ivan succumbs to a belief in Satan appearing before him, because in that he is tacitly accepting the existence of hell, and thereby heaven and Catholicism. One can't have Satan without that which Satan is positioned against. I think what frustrates me most in Dostoevsky's treatment in Ivan is how his philosophy approached and interacted with in the plot, in that every character who embraces a part of it seems to be punished for it. While Dostoevsky succeeds in crafting a careful examination of what makes humanity tick, he too often lays down verdicts without substantial evidence--paralleling much of the oratory sentiments put forth in the great trial scene at the end of the book. Dostoevsky too often lays heavily into the faithless characters, portraying them more and more as pitiful rather than sympathetic, flawed humans by the time the book concludes. Dostoevsky too often presents us with ""the hero"" Alyosha without ever truly delving into what makes him such a hero, or why the townsfolk are so unequivocally enamored by him.

Dostoevsky certainly never comes out and says ""Atheism is bad, faith in God is good,"" and I don't mean to sound like I'm arguing that he is; however, is it only me that felt like his views on religion (that is to say, his devout Orthodox faith) came through a little too strongly? That his response to the unfaithful characters in his book do no justice to the questions they raise, reducing them to mere hypocrites (Ivan), murderers (Smerdyakov), and the wretched (Lise). How do we reconcile these fates with our own worldviews, those of us that have rejected the dogma of religion, especially if Dostoevsky provides no counterbalance harsh fates of the novel's unfaithful? Are the faithless in society meant to understand these instances as warnings and nothing more? That Ivan is redeemable, not through his intellect and rational mind, but through his sacrifice for his brother? Are we meant to read, too, that Ivan is breaking free from ""Satan's"" grip on him, that he is turning away from his hallucination's taunts, that reiterate Ivan's atheistic theories, poems, and parables that have now caused such a thorough insanity in his mind?

I don't believe that Dostoevsky meant to provide any Absolute Truths here, but I still feel like his personal beliefs noticeably underpin a significant portion of the narrative. For me, this is disappointing. Dostoevsky wants us to see Alyosha as a hero, and him alone, and by fixating on that I think he does a tremendous disservice to the multiplicity of ways of humanity can ultimately find meaning in life.

He's a native of Pittsburgh, where I go to school, and even here he seems to not receive much recognition from the academic/literary community. He's certainly not completely unknown by any means, he was recently given an honorary degree by my university, and is a two-time recipient of the PEN/Faulkner Award. However, I always see him referred to as a ""writer's writer"", which unfortunately seems an apt comparison. I have read some of his short works, as well as his novels  *Hiding Place* and *Sent for You Yesterday*, both of which are absolute triumphs. His lyricism in prose, as well as grasp on crafting an absolutely fabulous setting and placing memorable characters inside of it is second to none, and I have Wideman to thank for both my initial interest, and appreciation for, Faulkner and his work.

since the Nobel Prize in Literature will most likely be announced in around 4 weeks from now on, i'd like to ask who you'd like to see winning the nobel and why. My personal favorites:

**Thomas Pynchon** (80), American novelist. The most remarkable novelist alive in my opinion. His Œuvre is so rich and so diversified. Plus it would be fun to see him sending an actor to stage to accept the nobel for him.

**Cesar Aira** (68), Argentine novelist. His books are so much fun to read, so smart and well-written. He also would be the first winner from Argentina as far as i know.

**Karl Ove Knausgård** (48), Norwegian novelist. Of course he would be an unconventional choice here, but he wouldn't even be the youngest winner.

**William T. Vollmann** (58), American novelist. Can't wait for his next novel to be published. I'm not sure he's got a serious chance of winning the nobel already, but i'm pretty sure he'll be a favorite in a few years.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

Even so, they manage to stick with you, and even if you find yourself at odds with the novel at times, you find yourself feeling rewarded that you took such a task head on and completed it, finishing the good course.

Such is the case with Atlas Shrugged. The critics of this novel are right in many ways: the depiction of the characters is generally unrealistic and wooden; the prose feels lifeless and bloodless for the most part (with some good portions interspersed in the fairly passable and bland style); many things about its depiction of a collectivist society seen unrealistic (I say this as a libertarian who would go farther than even Rand on issues of politics); and it seems to have some sociopathic tonality to it that even I was frankly disturbed by.

Having said that, I would still consider it a ""good"" book in a sense, in part because of the heroic scope that Rand uses. The heroes are unrealistically heroic in a way, but even in the unreality they give their own compelling nature. Francisco D'Anconia, John Galt, Dagny Taggart, Hank Rearden —*all of these have their own heroism that I find very difficult to disdain. All the villains are, of course, comically evil, and Wesley Mouch almost comes across as a bureaucratic Jar-Jar Binks (don't believe me? ponder on all the times he complains about unfairness and all the exclamatory tone with which he complains; it's cringe-worthy). But the most compelling of them, Dr. Robert Stadler, provides an intriguing foil to the main hero, John Galt. If anything, I would consider Stadler the true villain (not necessarily antagonist; James Taggart has that role). 

As for the philosophy, let's just say I agreed mostly on the politics and with parts of the philosophy expressed. However, I still am not an Objectivist. I believe in charity to others (though not via the welfare state). I believe that greed is not particularly good (though money isn't evil). And there is a great detriment to pure selfishness (though self-interest and individualism per se aren't evil). As a result, I would likely be more inclined to be positive toward this book than most.

Anyways, I gave it 4/5 stars because, even with all its great flaws and unskilled unreality, Atlas Shrugged managed to be a satisfying trek through such a long journey. As a piece of writing, it's mediocre and third-rate, with some choice passages and beautiful speeches. As a piece of pop storytelling, however, it's strangely compelling and beautifully paced considering how massive it happens to be. My 16-year old mind was able to get through this (though, to be fair, I also did get through Lew Wallace's verbose and plodding 19th century novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ). Plus, while I would consider Rand a mediocre writer in many ways, she does manage to give some hues of Romanticism along the likes of her hero Victor Hugo. While I think Hugo is leagues above her in style and complexity, Rand does manage to take the heroic quality of Hugo's best work and augment it to fit her own mold. Readers who wish to understand further Rand's own ethos of storytelling and fiction would be advised to look to her posthumous collection of essays The Art of Fiction, which I believe effectively sums up her literary values and has helped me appreciate her fictional magnum opus in this light.

Now let me say that I am not a Rand fanboy. I appreciate much of what Rand did in terms of political philosophy and even in terms of the big questions, but I have grave misgivings with her cultish traits and her atheistic views. I also happen to be opposed to her rabid pro-Israel stance (though in all fairness she was way more anti-war than most of her followers are). However, I would recommend that everyone read Atlas Shrugged at least once in a lifetime. It's ponderous, it's long, it's psychotic in many ways; but its story is strangely compelling, its 1950s soap-opera tone is nostalgic and evocative of the most entertaining pulp fiction, and its work is still influential (for better and/or for worse) in the minds of many. It's not a ""great novel,"" nor is it one of the greatest of the 20th century, but it's a ""good"" novel in its own way.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some novels may fail to be great by any literary standard.

It is fascinating to witness just how much an author&amp;#39;s conception of Self and Other can evolve in only a decade or so. He disagrees with himself (unconsciously) quite a bit. The resulting dialogue is complex as hell, hence: footnotes all the way down!&lt;/p&gt;

You wouldn’t judge all books based on Captain Underpants or an instruction manual, so please don’t judge all video games based on Call of Duty, and try to forget the stigma surrounding gaming

In addition to offering the standard elements of a good movie or book (engrossing storyline, deep character development, etc.), I believe that video games offer two very distinct features that are often overlooked.

The first is simply that video games are more than just written word: they are the combination of written storyline/dialogue, audio, and visuals. While some might prefer the more open-ended, imagination heavy style of a book, others might prefer to see their fictitious scenarios created in front of them. Paired with ambient music and the sound effects of the creatures inhabiting the story, the capacity for engrossment is much greater (for some people, at least). Take a look at this clip from [The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess](http://youtu.be/YWpt7PRfgxQ?t=9m29s). It’s not a terribly exciting moment in the game, and the game itself isn’t even hailed as a great example of the point I’m trying to make. But here’s the thing: 7 years ago when I played through this section of the game, I was more engrossed in that experience than any before it. When I saw it, with the mysterious, twilight-esque lighting and the creepy particle effects, it stuck in my head for the next seven years. Nothing here is even remotely similar of what video games get all of their bad press for, and yet it is one of my favorite moments in gaming. Will it have that effect on everyone? Probably not, but the opportunity is there.

The other main feature in video games would have to be the interaction between the player and the game. The perfect example of this would have to be The Walking Dead(2012). As you might guess from the title, you do kill a fair number of zombies in this game, but that is not the main appeal. The real appeal here is the control you have (or even the illusion thereof) over the story. The death of a well-developed character always has an emotional impact, but the death of a well-developed character, whose life YOU (the player) previously saved, impacts you even more. Just take a look at this [article](http://kotaku.com/5975065/if-you-didnt-make-this-choice-in-the-walking-dead-clementine-would-make-it-for-you). In disregard to the article itself, the comments section is full of debate regarding what was the right decision to make at the end of the game, plus there is a [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWalkingDeadGame) exclusively devoted to discussing this game (there are plenty of spoilers, if you have any intention of playing this game). It doesn’t really matter what the right decision was, it’s a video game, and none of these events are real. But anyone who has played The Walking Dead still cares about what happened, because the game made you think, it elicited a response (I know several people who have been brought to tears). 

I would never try to say that video games are deeper or better than novels, they’re just different. If nothing else, don’t judge an entire medium of literature on a few poor examples, and don’t let your opinion on this be skewed by the stigma surround gaming.


**TL:DR**: video games ought to be considered a form of literature. A few bad examples have skewed the public’s perception of the medium as a whole, but through the same elements as written word, in addition to direct interaction with the story, and video and audio to supplement your own imagination, video games have the capacity to be very rich experiences.

**edit**: I'm not going to change what I originally wrote, but I would like to clarify my intentions. What I originally meant to say is that film, video games, literature etc. are all valid forms of art. Video games are not literature, but they are both valid forms of art and respectable mediums through which a story can be told. Video games may not be literature, but I do believe they have the capacity to possess literary value and ought to be treated as such, and not dismissed as society has a habit of doing","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I propose: just like film or graphic novels have come to be accepted as literature, video games ought to treated the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

Yes, some may consider that story a lie, including yourself, but it's a human story nonetheless that helps you transcend the suffering and absurdity of it. Gimmicks do not equal genius, fair enough. But mythos isn't a gimmick, it's often a multivalent fact of life. Read *The Heart of Darkness* and tell me that reality makes for the better story. *Life of Pie* was an ode to the human art of storytelling and the human capacity to bend time and space and heaven into a beautiful thing of art.

It worked well for *In the Image* by Dara Horn. That's probably because that book has a nonlinear narrative. The last chapter actually made for a surprisingly good introduction. Every major theme that I noticed in the book was addressed in the final chapter, but not all of them were​ addressed in the first chapter.

It worked less well for *Second Hand Smoke* by Thane Rosenbaum. The last chapter buried me under an avalanche of names that I didn't know. But, reading the last chapter right before the first chapter made it clear how much the characters changed. So, it was still an interesting exercise.

So, I was wondering:

Do you guys ever read the last chapter of a book before you read the rest? Does it always work? If it works, then what makes it work? If it doesn't work, then what makes it not work?

The US tried to ""open up"" Russia to ""experiment"" with a new unfamiliar way of doing things, Capitalism. We see this occurring as the wealthy businessman Grey tries to pull the naïve young Anastasia (named after the famous Russian princess, because who has time for subtlety these days) to be part of his decadent world.

All of this transformation is done willingly by the fledgling Russian state and they step cautiously into this new way of life. They are told that they have the ability at any point to change their mind and say that they do not wish to continue down this path, but realistically their options are significantly limited due to the level of control the US has over their economy. Similarly, the protagonist of Shades enters into her contract with Grey willingly not realizing the level of influence this would give him over her life.

While at first it was new and exciting, the traditionalist streak within Russian society couldn't handle the rate at which the Americans were trying to insert themselves more and more into their lives. In the novelization, Grey assumes a dominant role in Ana's life, telling her what she can and cannot do under the terms of the 'contract' she agreed to.

Eventually this leads to a wholesale rejection of the American way of life and the Russians striking out on their own, once more independent from western influence. This lines up quite well to Anastasia's rejection of Grey at the end of the book and her desire to return to some level of normalcy free from his influence.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was just kicking around strange ideas the other day, and I realized that this actually made way more sense than one would assume, based on the quality of the source material.

Take poetry, for example. Poetry generally aims to move a person, to subvert rationality, to reveal the truths of the human experience. How can anyone claim to be 'correct' when studying poetry? Is poetry not just a medium by which we are to be moved, as a result of the poet's ability to be so tender to the human experience? If poetry achieves this effect on a person, regardless on how it does so, has it not achieved its aim? Of course if a person was to go very in depth about the parts of a poem which they find important, they may do so and anyone may agree or disagree with them. But why should this be considered academic and not just an interest? Is it a trait of academia to be practically irrelevant? I realise as I write this, this argument is probably a dumbed down version of one that already exists, not just for literature but possibly history as well, but there you go.

How can anyone claim to be &amp;#39;correct&amp;#39; when studying poetry? Is poetry not just a medium by which we are to be moved, as a result of the poet&amp;#39;s ability to be so tender to the human experience? If poetry achieves this effect on a person, regardless on how it does so, has it not achieved its aim? Of course if a person was to go very in depth about the parts of a poem which they find important, they may do so and anyone may agree or disagree with them. But why should this be considered academic and not just an interest? Is it a trait of academia to be practically irrelevant? I realise as I write this, this argument is probably a dumbed down version of one that already exists, not just for literature but possibly history as well, but there you go. If anyone generally understands what i&amp;#39;m talking about or can relate, i&amp;#39;d love to have some light shed on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

As if making the readers frustration with his pros would convey the main character K.'s frustration with the bureaucracy. 

Aside from how hard to read it was an aesthetic level, the book also straight up didn't make sense. For instance when K.'s assistants are introduced, K. plays along with the odd pretense of them being his former assistant's, when K. has in fact never seen them before. Why does he do this? Also for the entire first part of the book, K. makes vague allusions to some sort of driving purpose for his stay in the village, but by the end of the book we don't know any thing more about this purpose. More importantly, WHO GIVES A FUCK ABOUT KLAMM?? Ever character in the book freaken warships this guy Klamm, and Kafka never really shows us why. Kafka doesn't give you real insight into any charters motivation, and they don't even feel human. All there desires and reasoning seam skewed and you cant identify with them. I understand that he died before he could finish, and conceivably all this stuff could have been worked out in his later plan for the book, but if the first 316 pages of the book that he DID write are any indication, i doubt it.

I feel like we often times give the classic's too much credit and when we don't like one of them we don't voice our complaints because we don't want to seem stupid for not understanding them.

So I'm in a book club, which at its outset focused on Pulitzer Prize-winning novels; now that we're trying to branch out we've been having mixed results at best in terms of book quality, at least in my (not so) humble opinion. This month's offering is no exception: the Giller prize-winning *Runaway* by Alice Munro, who is herself a Nobel laureate. I'm about halfway through the book, and I'm a little concerned with how I'm reading it, because I honestly can't see why her writing has any literary merit whatsoever. The prose is utterly devoid of economy, but at the same time has none of the beauty which graces the writing style of other long-winded authors. Her use of symbolism is clunky and completely devoid of subtlety (the goat in ""Runaway"", as well as *Aethopica* in ""Silence""), and the characters are almost uniformly insufferable to read about. The long and short of it is that it's boring without being at all challenging, and it feels like I'm just reading aimless drivel. She is clearly writing with the hopes of being approachable to people of all education levels, but unlike other authors with similar prerogatives (eg Steinbeck), is unable to use this style to ask big questions, at least the way I'm reading it. What am I missing? She's an almost uniformly praised author, certainly in the opinions of many with more experience with literature than myself, so there has to be something here.

1. Denial and Isolation

2. Anger

3. Bargaining

4. Depression

5. Acceptance

I read this novella for my World Literature class, and I was surprised that nobody in the class pointed out how closely the family goes through these stages. I'd like to make this the topic for a Literary Analysis paper assignment.

My findings:

Gregor and his family alike first deny/ignore the fact that he's been turned into a bug, being more concerned with being late for work that the fact that he's completely transformed.

For the continuation of the story, Gregor is isolated from his family (or rather, the family isolates themselves from him) by locking him in his room. They avoid all contact with him, and only once is he directly spoken to by his family.

Angry outbursts are aplenty, with Gregor's father hissing at him, swinging the attorney's cane, throwing fruit, and the outburst during Greta's violin performance.

Bargaining seems a little less defined; I take it from Gregor listening to his family's dinner conversations and trying to save his picture frame. Any other examples would be greatly appreciated!

Depression is more scattered, primarily in Gregor's mother, but the violin recital scene seems to bring out of a lot of suppressed feelings in the entire family.

And lastly, acceptance. Applying the five stages puts a little more sense into why Gregor's family is so unmoved by Gregor's death; Gregor ""died"" as soon as he started paying for his family's house, being less of a family member and more of a faceless laborer.

I watched the introduction to ""Milton"", entitled  ""Milton, Power, and the Power of Milton"".

I learned that Milton's literary power was ""violent"". The manner that this word was used was very much in keeping with the ""verbal violence"" ideology of some of our more current theorists who, in my opinion,  use literature simply as a conduit to talk about the things they really want to talk about: that is, feminism, gender, LGBTQ,  and anything that falls within the Cultural Studies umbrella of special interests that have alienated our craft from anyone that just wants to learn about literature without the ever-growing portfolio of special interests attached. 

Anyway, after being informed about the ""violence"" of Milton -- I was taught that he apparently could not be just plain powerful as a writer because, after all, he was white and male (so the lecturer apologized) and so of course he could not be just a really good writer.The lecturer then went on to talk about Virginia Woolf for most of the class. (She is apparently very good, also, but the lecturer did not mention whether or not she was violent). I learned more about ""A Room of One's Own"" than I did about any of Milton's poetry. Come to think of it, I didn't learn much of anything about Milton at all, except that he must have been a very ""violent"" man in the Judith Butler kind of way.

I think that it is time that literature professionals collectively say *enough of this*. I cannot understand how anyone connected to the craft of literary criticism can tolerate this sort of excrement. We have come to the point where one of the finest universities in the land can't teach Milton in a class about Milton. They feel the need to teach Judith Butler via Virginia Woolf in a lecture on Milton instead.

I'm not really looking for an apology or defense of such obvious snobbery, I'm just more curious why r/literature thinks ""genre fiction"" is so disdained by the literary establishment, whether or not the stigma is deserved, and what its effects have been on the landscape of the whole of fiction?

In my experience I would say it's been mostly negative for me: when I was young, I read science fiction pretty religiously and loved it. I avoided literary fiction not so much out of a natural inclination but because I assumed there was nothing within that section of the bookstore that would appeal.

Later in my life, I began to discover how much great reading I'd been missing out on - being subscribed to here is a part of that continuing education. But in essence, I feel robbed.

But it seems this gap is rarely bridged from the other direction. I get the sense there are a lot of serious readers that avoid genre because it is stigmatized and are missing out themselves in much the way I was. In the very Liberal Arts Education aim of being well-rounded, this strikes me as terribly destructive for the development of any reader or writer.

I would think cross-pollination and the disintegration of boundaries in fiction would lead to much more diversity in voice and plot, greater originality on the whole, and more interesting approaches to telling stories - in short it would enrich all of fiction.

&lt;p&gt;You may think I am saying this just because i don&amp;#39;t  &amp;quot;understand&amp;quot; ancient plays, but I read &lt;em&gt;Oedipus Rex&lt;/em&gt; before this and I really enjoyed it.  Plot, characterization, symbolism, everything!  Lysistrata has a good idea, but doesn&amp;#39;t really do anything interesting with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you guys can point out some stuff to me that I&amp;#39;m missing.  Also discussion about the play is encouraged! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also im not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, is there anywhere else i should bring this up?&lt;/p&gt;

The book is written from the point of view of the professor, so we have an unreliable narrator. But the clues are all there as to what really happens. Yet several reviewers and discussions I've read show that many readers can't decide what is real and what isn't.

The Board's list is 100 novels long. Most of the heavy hitters are there. But there is one, extremely heavy hitter which is conspicuously absent: Gravity's Rainbow.

Now, yes, I am insanely and overwhelmingly obsessed with Gravity's Rainbow, it's true, so for me, personally, this is an outrage. But in a larger sense, WHAT IS THE DEAL?! Upon publication, it was universally recognized as a masterpiece. The quantum leap that the novel had taken with Ulysses took another one in 1973. Even today, the lit establishment recognizes it as THE postmodern novel. No one went bigger and no one did better than Thomas Pynchon with GR. 

And yet: It doesn't make the cut. 

And SlaughterHouse-Five is 18. Now, I LOVED SlaughterHouse-Five. Besides Breakfast of Champions, its the best Vonnegut book by far. But no one in their right mind can read SH5 carefully and thoroughly and then read GR carefully and thoroughly and claim that these books are from the same planet of genius. Even comparing the two is laughable, much less claiming the former is superior. Anyone with a degree in literature, who serves on the board of the Modern Library either sees that abundantly clear reality, or HASN'T CAREFULLY AND THOROUGHLY READ GR!

I really think that's it. The book is just so freaking hard. No harder than Ulysses, mind you. But Ulysses had the great fortune to be written before WWII, and thus has been comfortably canonized, and people will put tremendous effort into something that has been canonized. But Gravity's Rainbow missed that boat by a bit. So, this book is so freaking hard, that to read it only once will get you no where. But, to paraphrase Nabokov, there are no readers, only rereaders. So it's my belief that these Modern Library frauds just didn't do their reading.

I'm wondering if any of this means anything about literature's place in the public sphere right now. I don't want to get all sign of the timesy, but that thread brought out the lit-snob in me, but fuck it I'm on my worst behavior, and you guys probably wouldn't be here unless you were lit-snobs too. I thought it was funny but unsurprising. I knew before clicking it that the top comment would be some shit on how *Hitchhiker's* is just the most important thing ever written. If anything, I think the post is interesting to look at because it reflects modern attitudes about literature amongst the young and educated. I don't really have any concrete proof, but I think the zeitgeist is moving toward ""arts &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; humanities are fluff and STEM is all that matters."" I feel like intellectuals of the future will take literature less seriously, but that's just a hunch.

The rest of the thread listed: 

 - Assorted sci-fi in the Orwell/Huxley/Bradbury/Vonnegut tradition: *""This appeals to my STEM sensibilities, as well as my anti-authoritarian and anti-religious views!""*

 - Clever or edgy answers: ""Mein Kampf is actually a very important work and Hitler was actually a very interesting person."" *No shit.* Hitler was a lot of things, but he certainly wasn't uninteresting. That he's worthy of study isn't an unpopular or controversial opinion.

 - Religious texts. Here  /r/atheism turns up to boldly declare that the Bible is *actually important*: ""Though I am personally an atheist, I find the Bible to be..."" as if being an atheist means dismissing religious texts outright.

 - 10th grade English Lit required reading list a la TKAM, Of Mice and Men, etc.

Not that these selections are bad -- many of them *are* essential works -- but Reddit's taste in literature is in general pretty undercooked, and I'm not sure how much the average redditor actually reads (material that isn't sci-fi, at least). To the well-read person, the claim that *any* work is ""the most brilliant work of fiction of all time"" will sound silly. I think that the more you read, the more you feel the vastness of literature,  as it stretches over over time, geography, and imagination. The more you read, the more you realize how little you've actually read, sort of like when Socrates declared, ""The only thing I know is that I know nothing.""

Any thoughts on that thread or attitudes about literature? Is it pointless to argue about taste? How will the general educated public relate to lit in the future? Why are you more sophisticated and enlightened than those basic nerds? After all, is sort of the purpose of this sub, right? To escape all that in favor of more informed or more rigorous dialogue about books. This place is basically founded on elitism! And I mean that in a good way.  

I know that I probably shouldn't care about these things. We may say, “You can’t argue about taste,” but when it comes to art we care about, we almost always do. Saying that ""it's all subjective, man"" is just smug and unsatisfying. 

To get even more tangential, Virginia Woolf wrote about this in her famously snobbish essay, [Middlebrow](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91d/chapter22.html). She talks about highbrows, those who combine innate taste with sufficient wealth to sustain a life dedicated to art. And then the lowbrows, working class people who had neither the time not the taste for the artistic life. She  admired the lowbrows for doing the work that highbrows didn't want to do, and for accepting their cultural inferiority (*I said it was snobbish*)

But she expresses only disdain for a third class — the “middlebrows”— who have earned enough money to buy the marks of a high culture that they could never properly appreciate. Middlebrows pursue “no single object, neither art itself nor life itself, but both mixed indistinguishably, and rather nastily, with money, fame, power, or prestige.” 

Isn't that something worthy of being upset over? The middlebrows annoy me too. I think Woolf overlooked a couple things that make a middlebrow though: laziness and indifference. People who just don't invest the time into reading, or worse yet, those who don't think it's a valuable pursuit at all. A waste of time that would be better spent pursuing maths. That's what I see a lot in the STEM community, and by extension, reddit. That *a story* can unlock important truths about ourselves and the universe seems ridiculous to them. As such, the arts &amp;amp;amp; humanities are reduced to fluff. Why on earth would anyone go to *college* to study *Literature*? *What a waste of money.* I'm probably just being alarmist, though. I'm sure the literary discipline will get on just fine without people like me complaining about the middlebrows.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the top-most comment in an &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/25ntl3/what_is_one_book_that_everyone_should_have_in/""&gt;askreddit thread&lt;/a&gt; today which asked what people think is the most essential book.

&lt;p&gt;Not that these selections are bad -- many of them &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; essential works -- but Reddit&amp;#39;s taste in literature is in general pretty undercooked, and I&amp;#39;m not sure how much the average redditor actually reads (material that isn&amp;#39;t sci-fi, at least). To the well-read person, the claim that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; work is &amp;quot;the most brilliant work of fiction of all time&amp;quot; will sound silly. I think that the more you read, the more you feel the vastness of literature,  as it stretches over over time, geography, and imagination. The more you read, the more you realize how little you&amp;#39;ve actually read, sort of like when Socrates declared, &amp;quot;The only thing I know is that I know nothing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts on that thread or attitudes about literature? Is it pointless to argue about taste? How will the general educated public relate to lit in the future? Why are you more sophisticated and enlightened than those basic nerds? After all, is sort of the purpose of this sub, right? To escape all that in favor of more informed or more rigorous dialogue about books. This place is basically founded on elitism! And I mean that in a good way.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I probably shouldn&amp;#39;t care about these things. We may say, “You can’t argue about taste,” but when it comes to art we care about, we almost always do. Saying that &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s all subjective, man&amp;quot; is just smug and unsatisfying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get even more tangential, Virginia Woolf wrote about this in her famously snobbish essay, &lt;a href=""http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/w/woolf/virginia/w91d/chapter22.html""&gt;Middlebrow&lt;/a&gt;. She talks about highbrows, those who combine innate taste with sufficient wealth to sustain a life dedicated to art. And then the lowbrows, working class people who had neither the time not the taste for the artistic life. She  admired the lowbrows for doing the work that highbrows didn&amp;#39;t want to do, and for accepting their cultural inferiority (&lt;em&gt;I said it was snobbish&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she expresses only disdain for a third class — the “middlebrows”— who have earned enough money to buy the marks of a high culture that they could never properly appreciate. Middlebrows pursue “no single object, neither art itself nor life itself, but both mixed indistinguishably, and rather nastily, with money, fame, power, or prestige.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t that something worthy of being upset over? The middlebrows annoy me too. I think Woolf overlooked a couple things that make a middlebrow though: laziness and indifference. People who just don&amp;#39;t invest the time into reading, or worse yet, those who don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a valuable pursuit at all. A waste of time that would be better spent pursuing maths. That&amp;#39;s what I see a lot in the STEM community, and by extension, reddit. That &lt;em&gt;a story&lt;/em&gt; can unlock important truths about ourselves and the universe seems ridiculous to them. As such, the arts &amp;amp;amp; humanities are reduced to fluff. Why on earth would anyone go to &lt;em&gt;college&lt;/em&gt; to study &lt;em&gt;Literature&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;em&gt;What a waste of money.&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;m probably just being alarmist, though. I&amp;#39;m sure the literary discipline will get on just fine without people like me complaining about the middlebrows.&lt;/p&gt;

That's my question: do you think Borges is overrated?

The thing is, I like his writings and enjoyed greatly reading his tales in my twenties, but today I pick up a book of his and can't really find anything of interest from a literary point of view.

Is like those authors they are not bad craftsmen and their writing is in fact wit and clever but I really cannot take them seriously as writers. In fact imo any other Boom writer like Carpentier, Lezama Lima, García Marquez, Miguel Angel Asturias, Rulfo, etc... is a far cry from him as writer.

As intellectual and influencer for sure he is a benchmark but I talk about his actual work, his tales basically (anyone really knows his poetry?).

For me is a bit like the case of those cubist painters that are interesting, they influenced a lot of colleagues and indeed you wouldn't even be able to understand painting today without acknowledging their work, but when we talk about their paintings... well, in most of the cases that's another matter.

I admit Borges is a great intellectual, a pundit and a big influence in some fields in literature, like Cyberpunk and such, but when we talk about actual literature, about literary quality or whatever you wanna call it I don't see him fitting in. I mean, do you think that he can play in the same league as Nabokov, Pynchon or Flaubert?

Not because I think it’s super important, but because I think the argument gets muddled. People’s feelings/pride get hurt when talking about what sort of art they enjoy and that's understandable but sometimes leads to hazy internet debate. Here are some important distinctions:

1. YA can be considered a genre but it isn’t what you normally think of when you think of genre fiction (Sci-fi, horror, mystery, etc) though it can contain elements from genre fiction. YA is essentially a larger marketing bracket that targets not just fans of mystery or fans of sci-fi (like bad genre fiction) but anyone in certain age bracket. So Neal Stephenson isn’t YA, William Gibson isn’t YA, Brian Evenson isn’t YA. These are adult writers writing adult fiction, though it could potentially be considered “genre” fiction. Don’t drag these people into YA.

2. The dichotomy of YA vs Literary Fiction (usually represented on Reddit by Joyce for whatever reason) is sort of false. This brings to mind extremes. YA is an extreme and consists only of literature written for children and teens. But there are many, many books for adults that aren’t literary. There are a ton of Stephen King books, a ton of John Grisham books, the Da Vinci Code, etc, that are for adults but not literary (not to mention all the genre fiction from my first clarification). So the actual dichotomy is YA vs adult fiction. Not everyone that reads adult fiction is reading lit fiction. You don’t have to be snooty not to read YA.

3. YA, in order to cater to the audience that provides its definition, will always appeal to the interests and concerns of teens and kids. There’s teen love, high school drama, peer pressure, divorce, growing up, etc. That’s the baseline. A good author can incorporate these teen interests into more complicated stories and ideas but it will always be limited by its audience. A child will always be the one that has to save the magical world.  

So to synthesize this shit for a second: YA is not “just as good” as regular fiction. It’s quintessentially simple. And though that lens of youthful naiveté can be refreshing, though it can sometimes make the truth seem lucid and obvious, it forsakes the complexity that often comes with deep thinking and ambiguity. Complex, adult ideas can be so much more nourishing than basic, moralistic YA. I don’t think there should be an argument that a necessarily limited art form, created specifically for a demographic, is greater or equal to an art form without that limitation. 

And yeah, there will always be some YA book that is sort of ambiguous or has some sort of adult theme, but those single elements aren’t YA elements, those are elements of adult fiction. And if the book was all adult themes and complexity it wouldn’t be YA.

Why do readers relate so much more to children than adults? I feel like they are still really immature in some way. Readers don’t “just enjoy” reading more about children than adults. Readers enjoy it for a reason. They relate more to teenage problems, teenage perspective. And that’s not good when you're a thirty year old dude.
 
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s been a lot of discussion on the web today about YA vs Literary Fiction and I wanted to write about it here. Not because I think it’s super important, but because I think the argument gets muddled. People’s feelings/pride get hurt when talking about what sort of art they enjoy and that&amp;#39;s understandable but sometimes leads to hazy internet debate. Here are some important distinctions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;YA can be considered a genre but it isn’t what you normally think of when you think of genre fiction (Sci-fi, horror, mystery, etc) though it can contain elements from genre fiction. YA is essentially a larger marketing bracket that targets not just fans of mystery or fans of sci-fi (like bad genre fiction) but anyone in certain age bracket. So Neal Stephenson isn’t YA, William Gibson isn’t YA, Brian Evenson isn’t YA. These are adult writers writing adult fiction, though it could potentially be considered “genre” fiction. Don’t drag these people into YA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dichotomy of YA vs Literary Fiction (usually represented on Reddit by Joyce for whatever reason) is sort of false. This brings to mind extremes. YA is an extreme and consists only of literature written for children and teens. But there are many, many books for adults that aren’t literary. There are a ton of Stephen King books, a ton of John Grisham books, the Da Vinci Code, etc, that are for adults but not literary (not to mention all the genre fiction from my first clarification). So the actual dichotomy is YA vs adult fiction. Not everyone that reads adult fiction is reading lit fiction. You don’t have to be snooty not to read YA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;YA, in order to cater to the audience that provides its definition, will always appeal to the interests and concerns of teens and kids. There’s teen love, high school drama, peer pressure, divorce, growing up, etc. That’s the baseline. A good author can incorporate these teen interests into more complicated stories and ideas but it will always be limited by its audience. A child will always be the one that has to save the magical world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to synthesize this shit for a second: YA is not “just as good” as regular fiction. It’s quintessentially simple. And though that lens of youthful naiveté can be refreshing, though it can sometimes make the truth seem lucid and obvious, it forsakes the complexity that often comes with deep thinking and ambiguity. Complex, adult ideas can be so much more nourishing than basic, moralistic YA. I don’t think there should be an argument that a necessarily limited art form, created specifically for a demographic, is greater or equal to an art form without that limitation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yeah, there will always be some YA book that is sort of ambiguous or has some sort of adult theme, but those single elements aren’t YA elements, those are elements of adult fiction. And if the book was all adult themes and complexity it wouldn’t be YA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do readers relate so much more to children than adults? I feel like they are still really immature in some way. Readers don’t “just enjoy” reading more about children than adults. Readers enjoy it for a reason. They relate more to teenage problems, teenage perspective. And that’s not good when you&amp;#39;re a thirty year old dude.&lt;/p&gt;

	Throughout American history, there has always been a religion, ethnic group, or race that has been pressed to the bounds of poverty by their environment and is marginalized by society. Both Richard Wright and Sherman Alexie emphasize the struggle of belonging to these minority groups with characters of different race and of different time period searching for a way to escape their environment and find hope. Both authors value the use of realistic characters, individuals who live within society, and naturalistic characters, characters that fall into a larger group and are products of society. Characters such as Richard of Black Boy, a young African American man from the deep south during the 1920’s and 30’s, and Arnold Spirit of The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, a young Native American boy from the Spokane Indian Reservation during more recent years are realistic and pursue hope by the breaking of stereotypes pushed on to them by society. Characters such as Rowdy and many characters in Black Boy show what the products of the surrounding environments are, giving the reader a picture of those who are controlled by society, making the aspects of realism stronger comparatively. In their novels, both Wright and Alexie show what it is like for the marginalized in society to take control of their environment by breaking society’s stereotypes and how the environment can react, with the use of both realistic and naturalistic characters.
	In both novels, Alexie andWright’s characters are placed in an oppressive environment composed of struggle and agony, filled with stereotypes and hopelessness that try to restrain characters like Arnold and Richard. These environments allow characters to distinguish themselves as realistic, by fighting the marginalizing society, or naturalistic, allow themselves to be oppressed by their surroundings. These oppressive societies are seen as the Spokane Indian Reservation in Alexie’s  The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, and the South and an intellectual oppression in the North in Wright’s Black Boy. These societies are used as tests in both novels as a challenge each main character has to face in order to establish their own self-identity.
	In The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, some of the issues that Arnold faces lie within his home of the Spokane Indian Reservation. The main issue that Arnold notices on the reservation is the amount of poverty his tribe faces. “Poverty doesn’t give you strength or teach you lessons about perseverance. No, poverty only teaches you how to be poor.” (Alexie 27). Arnold explains poverty as the largest enemy on the reservation, but mainly how the people respond to it. “My parents came from poor people who came from poor people who came from poor people, all the way back to the very first poor people.” (Alexie 24). Arnold observes that the true issue is the hopelessness in the reservation people and their acceptance of their own poverty and being poor people. The Reservation is also poisoned with stereotypes of alcoholism and abuse, both which Arnold points out to be very real. “Dad said I wasn’t listening...So he got all drunk and tried to make my ear a little bigger.” (Alexie 31). Arnold explains that the poverty leads the Native Americans to alcoholism and abuse, which is then inflicted on the next generation, continuing the cycle. Arnold realizes that he’s “got to get off the reservation if he's going to keep his mind and soul intact.” (Cheuse) and leaves to the neighboring, “white” high school of Reardon in pursuit of hope by escaping the reservation, hoplessness, and stereotypes that could kill him.
	Richard’s situation in the South is more intense in poverty and racial hate between whites and blacks. “What was it that made the hate of whites for blacks so steady, seemingly so woven into the texture of things? What kind of life was possible under that hate? How had this hate come to be?” (Wright 509). Richard takes an outside look on his society and questions why things were they way they were, why his society was controlled by hate and racism of white Southerns. Unlike Arnold in his 21st century set of laws, Richard faces a legal force in the early 1900’s Deep South, The Jim Crow Laws: a set of laws and codes endorsed by many southern states that allow open discrimination and segregation between whites and blacks. Richards sees this society being backed by these laws, making it even harder for blacks to rise or make progress in the South. “I was outside those laws; the white people had told me so.” (Wright 618). Richard feels he is not bound to the laws of the land, especially if rights aren’t even granted to him. He believes that society in the North will be more pleasant and freeing, a place where he is not bound by the Jim Crow Laws. When he leaves for the North in pursuit of his “hunger” for self-identification, he finds that it is its own oppressive society altogether.
	In the North, Richard was mostly correct about certain aspects of racial culture. He learns that he can trust people and that not all whites have a racial agenda in the North, like the Hoffmans, “I was persisting in reading my present environment in the light of my old one.” (Wright 802). Although, Richard learns how to cope with a world with less racial discrimination, he does learn of a whole new realm of oppression in the intellectual world of the North after joining several Communist parties. “‘You’re an intellectual,’ he said, smiling disdainfully.” (Wright 900). Through Richard’s hunger for knowledge in the North, he finds even more oppression in artistic and intellectual groups, not being judged on his skin color or limited by it but now by how he thinks and how curious he is.

The main issue that Arnold notices on the reservation is the amount of poverty his tribe faces. “Poverty doesn’t give you strength or teach you lessons about perseverance. No, poverty only teaches you how to be poor.” (Alexie 27). Arnold explains poverty as the largest enemy on the reservation, but mainly how the people respond to it. “My parents came from poor people who came from poor people who came from poor people, all the way back to the very first poor people.” (Alexie 24). Arnold observes that the true issue is the hopelessness in the reservation people and their acceptance of their own poverty and being poor people. The Reservation is also poisoned with stereotypes of alcoholism and abuse, both which Arnold points out to be very real. “Dad said I wasn’t listening...So he got all drunk and tried to make my ear a little bigger.” (Alexie 31). Arnold explains that the poverty leads the Native Americans to alcoholism and abuse, which is then inflicted on the next generation, continuing the cycle. Arnold realizes that he’s “got to get off the reservation if he&amp;#39;s going to keep his mind and soul intact.” (Cheuse) and leaves to the neighboring, “white” high school of Reardon in pursuit of hope by escaping the reservation, hoplessness, and stereotypes that could kill him.
    Richard’s situation in the South is more intense in poverty and racial hate between whites and blacks. “What was it that made the hate of whites for blacks so steady, seemingly so woven into the texture of things? What kind of life was possible under that hate? How had this hate come to be?” (Wright 509). Richard takes an outside look on his society and questions why things were they way they were, why his society was controlled by hate and racism of white Southerns. Unlike Arnold in his 21st century set of laws, Richard faces a legal force in the early 1900’s Deep South, The Jim Crow Laws: a set of laws and codes endorsed by many southern states that allow open discrimination and segregation between whites and blacks. Richards sees this society being backed by these laws, making it even harder for blacks to rise or make progress in the South. “I was outside those laws; the white people had told me so.” (Wright 618). Richard feels he is not bound to the laws of the land, especially if rights aren’t even granted to him. He believes that society in the North will be more pleasant and freeing, a place where he is not bound by the Jim Crow Laws. When he leaves for the North in pursuit of his “hunger” for self-identification, he finds that it is its own oppressive society altogether.
    In the North, Richard was mostly correct about certain aspects of racial culture. He learns that he can trust people and that not all whites have a racial agenda in the North, like the Hoffmans, “I was persisting in reading my present environment in the light of my old one.” (Wright 802). Although, Richard learns how to cope with a world with less racial discrimination, he does learn of a whole new realm of oppression in the intellectual world of the North after joining several Communist parties. “‘You’re an intellectual,’ he said, smiling disdainfully.” (Wright 900). Through Richard’s hunger for knowledge in the North, he finds even more oppression in artistic and intellectual groups, not being judged on his skin color or limited by it but now by how he thinks and how curious he is.&lt;/p&gt;

In this past spring at my university I completed an introductory course to literary theory and criticism. Grappling with many of the texts, which ranged from Samuel Johnson to Baudrillard and Zizek and everything in between, including the fields of psychoanalysis, marxism, feminism, structuralism, deconstruction, and post-modernism, I often found myself struggling with material rewarding as it is tedious. Several times i threw my Norton Anthology of Literary Theory and Criticism on the floor, at the wall across the room, but ideally somewhere soft in rage at my confusion and inability to comprehend certain ideas after countless re-readings of the same paragraph or sentence, and yet afterwards in class, when the ideas were discussed and explained and I managed to wrap my head around them, I couldn't help but feel that there was more of me.

Skipping ahead to now, I find myself at a crossroads on just why it is I read and my identity as a reader. I was hoping to facilitate a discussion on some of the reasons why you read and how you identify yourself as a reader. Is it for fun? Is it to grow? Is it to prove to yourself you were capable of sitting in a single place and actually focusing on one thing for once your life?

It is my hope that this will lead to a discussion of the value of literary theory and criticism in our reading lives, whether or not is is necessary, whether or not it is worthwhile, and so on.

(If you're interested: A few days ago I completed David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest, having chosen to read it as an exercise to apply some of the theory and criticism I learned this past spring, as well as to present to myself some inner-illusion of having done something productive with myself. I now find myself looking for something, to put it bluntly, easier, that doesn't require so much surgery, extraction, and projection of events. As such I have picked up ""The Golden Compass"", a linear narrative fantasy novel written probably for a younger audience that myself (19). I've sort of given up trying to present this as a desperate cry for the approval of strangers, and am wondering what you might think of this decision to regress to something, shall we call it, more fun. I believe The Golden Compass in juxtaposition with Infinite Jest presents a certain dichotomy of reasons why one might read, fun vs. rewarding hard work.

Can fun be rewarding? Can hard work be a waste of time? Without further ado, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

The sole criteria for admissibility to the subreddit should be quality and relevance. With regard to 'amateur' writing, many of the best discussions here come from self posts anyway - it makes little difference whether the text is a self post or hosted on a blog where the author, rather than reddit, might make a little money from ads or referral.

Whether a writer works for Granta or uses blogspot.com, they are still just someone writing about literature for what little money they might make off ads. Poor quality content with intrusive advertising should be downvoted no matter where it is hosted or who submits it.

The great thing about this subreddit and the internet in general is that it democratizes (or meritocratizes) the process of discussing literature. Banning user-submitted or 'amateur' articles would be a snobbish, anachronistic backwards step.

There are many parallels between the AI ""Jane"" from the Ender Quartet and ""Samantha""  from the movie 'Her'. You could actually rip a large portion of the conflict/resolution in the movie from pages of the books. There are many overarching themes common to both (I'll focus on one) and I'm wondering if you think that a movie like this enhances or detracts from the literary work it is related to? 

One primary issue, salient perhaps because it hits you right in the face, is jealousy. In the quartet, Jane is jealous of Ender in multiple ways. She is jealous that he is a ""being"", jealous of his relationships with other women (and men), and jealous that he has a known story, a history. Both Ender and Jane are jealous of each others ignorance. Oversimplifying it, Ender's ignorance of the forest and Jane's ignorance of the trees. Big problems arise when Ender takes out his earpiece, slighting Jane. Ender is jealous of the link that forms between Jane and the Queen (hive-mind), that he cannot be a part of. TL;DR the relationship between human and AI is a dynamic duality. The things that make it great are also eventually its undoing. 

In a way, the movie gives a visual of what a relationship with an AI would be like. It gives Jane a voice you can hear and all of the tone, inflection, and pitch that goes with it. Yet, the relationship covered in such detail throughout the movie is developed over thousands of pages in the Quartet. 

Which do you prefer? 

Does the movie change the way you thought about Jane, or AI in general?

Call it naivety, but i had hoped that things would be different here. Even in college, i'm forced to choke down books utterly lacking in plot, identity, or ingenuity (Not to mention the many that are utterly lacking in ANY character definition). So i feel like i must pose the question, how. How did these steaming chunks of garbage make it onto the bestseller list, and more importantly, why are they shown to kids?

Do bear in mind, that this is based upon my experience. Yours may differ, or share similarities.

So without further ado, here is what i read, and why they were AWFUL. At the end i will add a list of books that i feel should be read before a student leaves High School. Feel free to add suggestions.

The Giver. An overcomplicated plot that skirts the issues of overpopulation and abortion with an over-simplified story. If you expect anything in the form of backstory... Yeah no. Nothing is explained. It's ""The forest of hands and teeth"" with a dumbed down plot, and nothing of any interest to anyone. Somehow a bestseller. Maybe people like the idea of a child going through pain and suffering to learn irrelevant materials, before choosing his own desires over the needs of the community? I hope not. This story treats children like insects, and brushes away everything necessary in a story except the simplistic plot. Honestly this seems like a terrorist novella if you think about the future of society. Hell, Cabin in the Woods had a less suicidey ending, and a far deeper plot.

Tangerine. What a train wreck. While i don't hate this story with the inflamed passion i hold for The Giver, I still despise it. It is a pointless story of a boy who lacks peripheral vision because of an ""Accident"" caused by his brother, who his parents obviously favor. There is no message in this book that a kid could learn from. The brother gets away with crime after crime, until he murders a man. Even then, the parents care more about his future as a sportsman, than about the murder. And the concept of a soccer player without peripheral vision is ridiculous. Thats like a man without a lower body becoming a professional basketball player because he ""wanted it"". Cute. It would make a good main point for the story, but instead of the power of hard work, the book glosses over his soccer career, skipping to some bullshit with the brother that nobody could get invested in. The characters were as tasteless as boiled sheep and the plot felt more confused than anything else.

The House on Mango Street. This is literally, the perfect literature for an artsy asshole. Stick it on a table to inspire conversation with hispanics, but don't bother reading it. A book of prose, detailing the life of a young Hispanic girl, this book brings nothing new. Or even interesting. It's just... There. It details the hardships of life in a poor hispanic family, but seriously people! A book about ethnic people doesn't magically make it good! I see this a lot. Though it could just be that i live in California. As much as I hate bringing race into a book review, here i have to. This book is flat-out boring, just like the next book on this list.

Diary of a Part Time Indian. Ground breaking. A book that discusses masturbation, sexuality, and the issues a teenager faces. It made it into school, it exposed us to new topics and ideas. Of all the books on this list, this one is my favorite. That being said, i wish it had been better delivered. So much of the story feels like needless filler.

Now for the books i loved, both from school and from outside. The Little Chinese Seamstress. About the tragedies of communist China and it's war on intellectuals. Light-hearted for the most part, with SERIOUS undertones, this story treats children like growing adults. Something too few stories pull off properly. There's romance, but it's REAL romance. The kind that isn't magically lovey-dovey, the kind that isn't ""Oh i love you."" ""Oh i love you!"" Like Romeo and Juliet. No, these characters evolve, and keep evolving, until they make a choice. The choice is sad, but could anyone honestly say that they'd choose otherwise? And the message at the end of the book... It's deep.

H. G. Wells 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. This is a spectacular tale, from the man who read time himself. H.G. Wells created a masterpiece of scientific genius, expressed in a way that the common man can understand.

The Ingenious Gentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha. More adult material than i'd usually mention, but High Schoolers are approaching adulthood. They need to learn what life is like, and the fantasy story of an adult following his dream is a beautiful way to do this.

Anything by Isaac Asimov. The master of science fiction, his books should be preached on street corners. Exposing a child to science fiction should be done as soon as possible. A child is never to young to see fantastical fantasy world perfectly blending with practical science and mathematics. Even before a kid can understand, the messages will stay.

Tolkien. Just Tolkien. This man crafts timeless tales in a way that Frankenstein could only dream of doing. His words have a poetic flow to them, and the effort put into his stories is tangible.

Manga. I'm sure that i will be flamed for this, but Graphic novels are an important aspect of reading. They teach dialogue, in a way that books can't. Simple, back and forth dialogue that takes on endless new meanings.

Finally, the last one. Another one that I'm sure will be controversial. Fanfiction. Yes fanfiction. It doesn't even matter what type, or who wrote it. Fanfiction teaches critical thinking in ways that schools fail to. It shows students how a story can be interpreted differently. Harry Potter for instance, after fanfiction pointed out some stunning points, I realized just how much of an evil character Dumbledore is. In fact, the only reason we see him as good, is all the times he says he's good!

I am in no way saying that all Fanfiction is good, or even worth reading, but within the genre, hunks of gemstones can be found.

What else should students read? What else shouldn't they? Throw a suggestion my way, and If i like it i'll add it to this list. Disagree? Tell me why and if your argument is good, i'll alter things as i must.

I wanted to know what everyone thinks is the greatest difference between American and European literature, particularly in the late 19th and 20th centuries?

I have found it more experimental, less pragmatic in word choice, and sometimes less cliched and more diverse in subject matter.

What does everyone else think?

A literary work can be great in two ways then: In its form or in its novelty.

When a work is great for its form, it is copied wholesale. People will be exposed to a work in a form very close to its original form. Almost all poetry is admired for its form. 

A work can also be admired for its novelty which can be seen in several ways. Perhaps it deals with a new subject matter, like how modernism began to deal with psychology very seriously. Or it can be important for introducing a new type of work like how Poe introduced detective fiction. Novelty also covers archetypes. For instance, Action Comics #1 is remembered for its novelty, not its form.

I think these two types of literariness should not be confused as they often are in High School English classes. There are plenty of works that can only be appreciated for their novelty or for their form. I have no doubt, whatsoever, that people will be reading Action Comics #1 in 500 years, so long as anyone is still living.

My question is: Why are the two so correlated? I just read Don Quixote which, in so many ways, is apparently a novel work in many ways: its use of realism, its intertextual elements, and originality in its story. But it's a masterpiece of form in its own right.

And it seems to be pretty par for the course in my experience. Many many works are valued both for their novelty and their form. As far as I know, Crime and Punishment introduced the Cat &amp; Mouse mystery story. But it's also a masterpiece in its own right.

I bought the *In the Woods* audiobook and finished it just now. Her writing at its best is quite lovely: the passage at the beginning describing the summer of 1984, and the one near the end about “pure evil” are stand-outs. 

But I found her writing to be grossly uneven and oftentimes silly. Her pop culture references were stale and lazy even in 2007, such as when she describes a character looking “like Kenny from Southpark,” or when she compares a violent prison to the TV show “Oz.” 

The central partner dynamic is impossibly hard to believe. To wit, a *friendship*, between *work colleagues*, who are *male and female*, who are *intimate* with one another (foot-rubs, sleepovers), whose friendship is *completely platonic*, into which the merest notion of sex has *never even crossed the protagonist’s mind* … that’s not a friendship that has ever happened. Ever. Her lengthy descriptions of their charming patter grow tedious and insufferable as the book drones onward.

The identities of the murderer, the murder-planner and the significance of the central weapon were all apparent from practically their introductions. The descriptions of each were so oddly lingering and biased that I couldn’t help but assume they were pivotal.

So many unpursued asides. A hair piece in the woods. A supernatural event. A lot of exposition fuelling a tangental mystery that is never resolved. An epically long court scene unrelated to either crime, serving no purpose. The descriptions of the implausible friendship and the minutiae of his roomate’s behavioural tics is mind-numbing. A half-decent editor could’ve pared this thing down to 200 pages no problem.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cribbed a number of authors’ names from a &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/literature/comments/4t31cs/the_rise_in_literary_crime_novels_theres_nothing/""&gt;thread from a couple days ago about literary mystery/crime novels&lt;/a&gt;, and of all of them &lt;strong&gt;Tana French&lt;/strong&gt; seemed to have garnered the most praise. (Well, her and &lt;strong&gt;Raymond Chandler,&lt;/strong&gt; but hard-boiled is a very specific sub-genre and not what I was looking for.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought the &lt;em&gt;In the Woods&lt;/em&gt; audiobook and finished it just now. Her writing at its best is quite lovely: the passage at the beginning describing the summer of 1984, and the one near the end about “pure evil” are stand-outs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I found her writing to be grossly uneven and oftentimes silly. Her pop culture references were stale and lazy even in 2007, such as when she describes a character looking “like Kenny from Southpark,” or when she compares a violent prison to the TV show “Oz.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central partner dynamic is impossibly hard to believe. To wit, a &lt;em&gt;friendship&lt;/em&gt;, between &lt;em&gt;work colleagues&lt;/em&gt;, who are &lt;em&gt;male and female&lt;/em&gt;, who are &lt;em&gt;intimate&lt;/em&gt; with one another (foot-rubs, sleepovers), whose friendship is &lt;em&gt;completely platonic&lt;/em&gt;, into which the merest notion of sex has &lt;em&gt;never even crossed the protagonist’s mind&lt;/em&gt; … that’s not a friendship that has ever happened.

The fact that Kurtz was worshipped as a god and, at last by implication, taken a native woman as his lover was treated as an abhorrent act by the main character, why?

* Gothicism - A lot of the old Gothic classics, like Anne Radcliffe's *Mysteries of Udolpho* or Charles Maturin's *Melmoth the Wanderer*, contain stories within stories. Especially in something like *Melmoth*, the main narrative or narratives are discovered and related by a third party.

* I'm not sure what to call this one, really, but Zampanò's blindness really reminded me of the Homeric tradition. Wasn't Homer blind?

(By the way, the Gothic classes are fantastic.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postmodernism - I know, I know, it&amp;#39;s a no-brainer, especially with the scrambled text, back-and-forth narration, etc., but I&amp;#39;m actually thinking here of Lawrence Sterne&amp;#39;s 18th-century &lt;em&gt;Tristram Shandy&lt;/em&gt;. Talk about an early instance of subversion of the textual form! Crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure what to call this one, really, but Zampanò&amp;#39;s blindness really reminded me of the Homeric tradition. Wasn&amp;#39;t Homer blind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;m not going to give any spoilers here. I was just absolutely absorbed in this book! Has anyone here read any of Danielewski&amp;#39;s other works? I haven&amp;#39;t yet, but I&amp;#39;m definitely going to now.&lt;/p&gt;

Two things to know before launching into this: I saw the film adaptation long before reading the book, and I read the book on recommendation without knowing its historical context.

Having wrapped up the book, I'm left scratching my head to some degree. For a book about war, it spends an awfully long time talking about training. A rough estimate off the top of my head would put training, whether Rico's MI training or OCS, at around 2/3rds of the content.

This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's an interesting shift in the traditional SciFi war novel trajectory, as it makes the book seem much more introspective, as well as much more concerned with the formation of the soldier as opposed to the value of the soldier as a fighting instrument. This is likely intentional, especially  in light of the book as an allegory for anti-war sentiment in the post-Korean War environment.

That said, the heavily introspective nature of the book almost gives it the feeling of Atlas Shrugged, where long speeches and introspective monologues are really thinly-veiled policy statements from the author. Here, Heinlein replaces social construction with proper punishment, the merits and correct construction of statesmanship, and the virtues of honors earned.

All of this culminates in a finale that feels fulfilling. The conflict comes to a peak within 10 pages, and is over in another 10, only to lead into an ending that is so unlike the dark tone of the rest of the novel that I couldn't help but feel confused. While it cements the hero arc of Rico and cements the necessity of earning your position in life, I cannot, for the life of me, find a reason to rope Zim and Rico's Father back into the narrative as paragons of virtue, especially given the 'good soldiers die quickly' narrative that seemed to run through the rest of the book.

With all that said, I want to open the floor to those of you that have read it. What did you think?

Human beings have wondered about the future of society since the dawn of time. They have imagined fantastic flying machines and wild forms of entertainment, constantly making and occasionally fulfilling their prophecies. While most visions of the future predict a glittering, peaceful utopia, in keeping with the historic trend of steadily improving lifestyle, some visionaries have produced darker, grimmer visions of the world our descendants should live in. Two of the most iconic authors to write ‘dystopian’ novels are George Orwell and Aldous Huxley. Although on the surface, their visions of the future are almost polar opposites, a close reading of both will find that they tackle remarkably similar themes.  Both authors worried that society was going in the wrong direction and fashioned works that they hoped would change humanity’s course before it was too late. In their novels, Brave New World and 1984, Huxley and Orwell, respectively, use symbolism and irony in order to demonstrate that absolute truth and absolute control are mutually exclusive ends. 
	
One of the major symbols in 1984 is the paperweight that Winston purchases from Mr. Charrington. Winston clings to it because it symbolizes a connection with the past, proof that beauty existed at one time or another. The symbolism is enhanced by the very nature of the object: the coral contained within the cloudy glass cannot be touched, just as Winston cannot reach out and touch the solid history through the somewhat transparent, semi-reliable veneer of his own memory. When the paperweight is crushed by the Thought Police, Winston remarks about the coral contained therein “How small… how small it always ways!” (Orwell 184) Once the coral’s transparent shield was removed, it seemed small and insignificant. Allegorically, this represents how The Party can control the abstract past by manipulating the concrete record of it. Once Oceanian society has destroyed historical records, the abstract past at its core exists only in one’s memory and is of little significance to The Party. Orwell uses situations such as these to show the reader how dedicated the authoritarian party is to controlling information, or absolute truth, because knowing the oppressed knowing an oppressor is wrong is one of the greatest threats to any tyrant. 
	
Huxley uses a similar symbol in his novel to represent the elimination of absolute truth. The ‘Brave New Worlders’ constantly use an opiate-like substance known as soma in order to effectively escape from reality. The World State uses soma to replace conventional morality, and the drug is twice compared to Christianity throughout the course of the novel. Mustapha Mond calls it “Christianity without tears” (Huxley 238). In effect, soma prevents conflict by quelling negative feelings. This is exactly the type of order and stability that the World State encourages and promotes. However, when John tosses the days soma rations out the window, he also tosses out the aforementioned order and stability. Huxley thusly shows that soma holidays, or escapes from truth and reality, have become absolutely necessary to London’s status quo, and that citizens seeing the truth is counterproductive to the World State’s goals. 

Ultimately, Orwell’s symbolism proves more effective than Huxley’s. The many layers to the paperweight’s meaning offer rich opportunities for interpretation and analysis and Huxley’s soma looks remarkably one-dimensional by comparison. That is not to say, however, that Huxley’s symbolism is not effective, because as a satirical device, soma effectively critiques contemporary society’s penchant for self-medication and dodging the truth. Even so, the reflection of the paperweight’s symbolism onto The Party’s frightening ability to alter the present by controlling the past offers a far more emotional experience, especially through the later chapters, for the reader of 1984.

The two authors also make use of irony to communicate their themes. Indeed, the very nature of Oceanic society envisioned by Orwell is, by necessity, ironic. For instance, the tenants of doublethink dictate that the most important and fervently held beliefs must be both absolutely true and absolutely false at any given moment. This idea is used by The Party as a sort of psychological bludgeon to soften the minds of the people. The Party is so adept at this that they are actually able to convince thousands of people clamoring for an escalation of the war against Eurasia, that Eastasia is, in fact, the enemy, and has always been so. O’Brien explains how The Party uses doublethink to control the very fabric of reality to Winston: “…We control the mind. Reality exists inside the skull… We make the laws of nature” (Orwell 218). O’Brien is making the argument that perception is reality, and although this school of thought, solipsism, has been shown to be fallacious in multiple ways, he ironically manages to convince Winston otherwise using more fallacious arguments. Winston’s capitulation symbolizes the severance of his connection with objective reality and his utter acceptance of Party rhetoric. His inability to process truth allows makes him “infinitely malleable” (Orwell 216) for the Party’s purposes. 

Ironies such as these are integral to Ingsoc. For example, the idea that Big Brother is all-loving, yet works to undermine the family unit. Or that torture and interrogation should be carried out in a building known as the Ministry of Love. Or that “The enemy of the moment always represents absolute evil” (Orwell 32). All of these paradoxes, oxymoron and antitheses are used by Orwell to show the necessity of culling truth from society and replacing it with lies in order to assume absolute control. 

On the opposite end of the dystopian spectrum, Huxley also employs irony to demonstrate his themes. One of the most significant ironies shows itself in the form of allusion to Shakespeare made by John. Although on the surface it is ironic that the only true connoisseur of the high arts is known as ‘The Savage’, the irony of the situation goes much deeper.  John, an adolescent, is ironically juxtaposed against the adults of the World State and demonstrates far more emotional maturity, dealing with his feelings in an adult-like manner by relating to Shakespeare’s work. John recognizes the inevitability of adversity, and accepts it, saying to Mond “I want real danger… I want sin… I’m claiming the right to be unhappy” (Huxley 240). The adults, however, react childishly, spewing meaningless hypnopaedic phrases and popping soma tablets rather than facing their problems outright. Lenina is among the worst, repeating the phrase “Everybody is happy now” (Huxley 75) nearly a dozen times throughout the course of the novel. Ultimately, The Savage, by dealing with his emotions properly, becomes a source of instability, and is driven insane by his surroundings. The ‘Brave New Worlders’ on the other hand, continue to live perfectly ordered lives. This shows that the World State must, ironically, eliminate skills stemming from accepting reality, such as conflict resolution, in order to preserve order. 

In the context of conveying themes through the use of irony, the edge once again goes to Orwell, for painting a picture of a society deeply layered in contradictions and levels of meaning that cannot be adequately explored in just five pages of analysis. The true relation of 1984’s subtle and delicate irony to its rich themes can only be truly understood after multiple close readings of the work. Huxley’s Brave New World, although arguably more relevant as a satire, suffers from a major flaw that inhibits the work as a whole: The World State is conspiratorial. This implies that, rather than being the product of a natural social movement, society as known to the reader was diverted off its natural course to become the ‘Brave New World.’ Nineteen Eighty-Four, on the other hand, is not conspiratorial, and was, to Orwell, imminent. This implies that humanity was diverted off the course of totalitarianism and omnipotent government and onto the course of our current society and underlines the ultimate irony of 1984: the idea that humanity itself can become the hero of a tragic drama in which progress suppresses truth with the goal of absolute control.

In their flagship titles, Brave New World and 1984, Huxley and Orwell presciently offer differing visions of dystopian society. Orwell believed that the future would be filled with hurt and oppression. Huxley saw a world of blank expression and empty gratification. The two visions are so relevant and frightening to contemporary readers that in today’s society oppressive governments are called constantly compared to the Party while paradise engineering is met with cries of “It’s Brave New World!” Ultimately, both works fearlessly discuss relevant themes and issues that may prove to be key to preventing exactly the sort of hell that the authors feared most.

The question is as follows: what role do female characters play in Huck finn? how do they figure in the unfolding of the plot?  If you think the novel is advancing some point or points about the similarities and differences between males and females, be sure to say so and to substantiate your observations.

I have a few things i noticed except I'm not sure how to make them work together in an essay. and i am not sure if the novel is actually advancing any points about the similarities between males and females

1.) Huck has two female figures that aid in his upbringing:  The widow Douglass and Miss Watson  They lead him to believe that there are two ""Providences"" - one benevolent who rewards compassion ( from the widow douglass) and another that is looking to punish sinners (from Miss Watson).  While Huck would rather reside with the Widow Douglass's Providence he is constantly in fear of disappointing Miss Watson.  We see at the climax that Huck is more motivated by the implications his actions will have based on Miss Watson's ideals rather than the widow douglass's.  Even though he acted in compassion ( which would lead us to believe that he wouldn't in fact ""go to hell"" at least in the widow dougalss's providence)  he feels that he is in fact going to hell.  

2.) Gullibility seems to play a large role in Huck's interaction with female characters.  Some characters easily fall for Huck's lies ( like aunt Sally and the Wilks sisters) Some characters are not as easily fooled (Aunt Polly and Judith Loftus) when Huck interacts with Judith Loftus we see that she was very perceptive in deciphering that Huck was not infact a female.  She gave a list of reasons as to how she figured it out-- all detailing the ways in which males and females differ.   Huck lies to her again but she is unable to figure it out the second time ( Im not entirely sure why Twain decided to put this part in the novel at all)

That's pretty much what i have so far.  I basically need some more ideas on how to tie this together into a solid argument about female characters in Huck finn.

1) Mental illness may definitely be a reason for Emily’s eccentricities and generally bizarre behaviors.  What examples from the text may support this?
2) Why did the community not confront Emily, going so far to avoid it as to break into her house.  
3) What examples of “Southern society” may be seen in the story?
4) What influences of the society may have lent to the perpetuation of Emily’s behavior?
5) What might have been the narrator’s relationship to Emily?  He remains anonymous throughout the story, referring to themselves with the plural “we.”
6) What was the roll of “The Negro” in the story?
7) Could the pressures of being a proper southern woman have been a reason for Emily’s actions?
8) Despite her obvious mental infirmity, what logic may have resulted in Emily’s keeping of a corpse?
9) The time period for the story is believed to be during or after the American Civil War.  Based on what is known about the society of the time, why may the townsfolk have treated Emily in the manner they did?
10)  Some believe the story illustrates in one woman, the death of an era.  How might this be illustrated in the characters of Emily and the townsfolk?
11) How did William Faulkner use symbolism in the short story?
12)  How did Falkner use a broken and shuffled timeline to confuse and surprise the audience?  
13) What connections may be made between the deaths of Emily’s father and her lover?
14) How could the drastic changes in society of the time have caused Emily to act in such a bizarre fashion?
15) What may have been reasons for Homer’s actions toward Emily, despite her obvious attraction to him.  
16)  If arranged chronologically, could the ending of the story perhaps be more predictable?
17)  Did the broken chronology perhaps hide some of the strangeness of Emily’s character? If it had been presented differently, would the reader’s opinion of her have changed?

I did not like your 'Death Of a Moth'. 
If you lived in the 2010s, you'd have undoubtedly come across the concept of micro-blogging. Simply, its the idea that a thought can be compressed into 140 characters. It's taught our generation brevity. 

I think you need to learn about brevity.

You began with useless details about your home, your golden cat. You live alone with a cat. Get to the point.
Then another one about how a spider in your bathroom killed some moths. I'm not going to Google if Ernest Hemingway lived in the same decade as you, but you ought to read him. 
""translucent and ragged, their legs drying in knot…strips of chitin"".
It's disgusting. Why not let us imagine what the remains of a spider-ravaged moth look like?
Burning moths welded to cutlery which you used in the morning - that's all you write of a camping trip. No forests, trees, animals or birds. It's like you came to read and stare at moths. Just like you did at home.
It is also 600 words into the story that you actually get the real story. 
By the time you get the description of the moth's death, you've overloaded our senses with description - there's no contrast. The casual passer-by reader knows you as moth-lady by now. 
You do this again when the moth burns to death, as if the actual slow barbecue of the moth has some deep metaphorical meaning. Each injury, from the burning wings to the overall feeling that it's not the fire but you torturing the moth with a description you are conjuring up, char-blackening the moth's leg.

The only moment of beauty I found was the ""glowing horn shell of her abdomen and thorax…"", even in death, the moth's corpse feels somehow dignified. 

It is after this passage that your story really kicks in, even though it's morbid that you let this moth burn without swatting it out of the flame when it was caught in the wax. And that, for two hours. 

You read a book to inspire you by a burning corpse. The imagery of the new candle wick - this, ideally is where your story should have ended, an open ended ends that lets the reader use his perceptions. 
The next sentence - comparing the ember-like glow of the moth's head with ""a building glimpsed through silhouetted walls…"" ""flame-faced virgin gone to God"" - these sentences compelled me to pull back from the passage. They were too evoking. I still don't know what they evoke. Emotionally, they made me flinch. 
These three - the dark lonely night, Rimbaud's burning poems, and the burning moths - is a perfect build up for the next moment - in the classroom. 

I don't want to think of the moths in your bathroom again - it's too much emotional information. And I might soon agree with the idea of giving my life to be a writer. 

I'm afraid of the intensity you say I need to have , the ""going at life with a broadax"". It scares me.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Dillard,

A single, lone cosmonaut drifts in the solar sea

His wild eyes encased in a fishbowl

Confined by the white Kevlar vessel shielding the body

A generous casket, submissively manipulated with every turn

Careful stitching of his home flag rests upon his breast

Meaningless, for he has lost his way


They promised glory! O They promised fame!

He jumped through hoops in their name

Exploration and Space he never loved, a young tragedy in the making of

The sole goal, ambition: first place in the backwards marathon. He won.

Treacherously, tricked into the torment of a life he did not love

He did it for his country, his father, but he was led astray


This truth leapt out of a corner of his mind left unclean

At first rejected and revoked as if obscene

He fought, refused and ignored but it would not let go

Clawing into the sides of his mind trying to simply let him know

Blinded by the sun, he accepted and in entered the dismay

Broken, withered he will now decay


Slowly, he reaches for the notch on his helmet

With a quick movement he pays his debt

The Lexan is hardly budged as his eyes begin to bleed

Coughed up crimson mist fills, satisfying the bubble’s greed

The pressure is too much, a dark cloud manifests

Flash-frozen, once first in his class, he will shatter like glass

He died alone, the charlatan’s final play

I went to my favorite used bookstore in Tucson yesterday, and left with a giant stack of things that are classic readalouds. We're talking long stories, short stories, children's books, grownup fiction, nonfiction, etc.

I fly back to NYC Wednesday (I live on the outer edges of BK, work in Chelsea, and spend a lot of time hanging out in Washington Square flipping pennies into the fountain and scribbling in my notebook of great ideas because there's free wifi there and I commute through W4th) and I really want to get a group together and read aloud in the park on Saturday. Bring your favorite story - ideally, something a good bite of which can be read aloud in under an hour - and a friend, or maybe bring like seven of each.

PM me if this interests you, or comment below with your favorite readaloud stories and suggestions for where this could go!

By the time Walter Lee reaches the climax where he's on the floor sobbing in agony because he just gave away his family's money to a con artist, I wanted to break his spine.

I completely agreed with Beneatha's assessment of his character. A toothless rat indeed 

By the end of the play, I wanted to break his spine, pull out his brainstem, and skip rope with it. What kind of a selfish, prideful idiot do you have to be to not only squander your family's entire inheritance, but then also force your family into debt because they purchased a house with money they didn't know they didn't have anymore?!

I get the impression that the end of the play is supposed to be sort of a happy ending. Bittersweet, certainly, but hopeful. It isn't. All I could think was, ""How in the name of Zeus are they going to pay their mortgage?!"" That ending turns the play from a tragedy into a dumpster fire, wherein the audience is too emotionally exhausted by the protagonist's utter idiocy to drum up one single fuck more to give.

Am I missing something? Is the point of the play solely to make the audience cringe far more than is comfortable? Is Walter's last act in the play supposed to be somehow morally redeeming? While he couldn't completely erase the shame he brought on his family, by accepting Mr. Lidner's humiliating offer, Walter had the opportunity to at least lessen the concrete consequences of his actions, and he blew that, too. Maybe there's something to do with the time period or the family's race or something that makes the perception of right and wrong completely different. I'd hate to somehow come off as racist for not understanding some deeper moral implication, but isn't losing your pride in front of an enemy better than, you know, letting your family plunge further into poverty?

I suppose I have to blame Lena too. It was she who brought her family to ruins no less than three times, first by allowing Walter to touch the money in the first place, then by discouraging her daughter from having an abortion when they couldn't afford another child, then by making Travis stay in the room when his father was about to denigrate himself to save the family.

Still, both of Walter's bad choices remain his own.

I don't know about you, but I'd brown-nose my worst enemy and pretend to forsake all my values if doing so meant saving everyone I loved from eventual eviction and homelessness. Gods. 

If I were Walter I would have accepted the money to stay out of Clybourne Park, and with that money, I would have simply moved into another nice neighborhood just like it. Two birds, one stone. Maybe I'm the one with the moral deficiency, but I wouldn't defend anyone's honor if doing so meant condemning them to poverty. Either the play has its priorities wrong, or I do.

These passages are like brain-food, raw and unadulterated. DFW, on tennis:

&gt;One of the reasons the late James Incandenza had been so terribly high on bringing Schtitt to the Enfield Tennis Academy was that Schtitt, like the founder himself (who’d come back to tennis, and later film, from a background in hard-core-math-based optical science), was that Schtitt approached competitive tennis more like a pure mathematician than a technician. Most jr.-tennis coaches are basically technicians, hands-on practical straight-ahead problem-solving statistical-data wonks, with maybe added knacks for short-haul psychology and motivational speaking. The point about not crunching serious stats is that Schtitt had clued Incandenza in, all the way back at a B.S. 1989 **[33]** U.S.T.A. convention on photoelectric line-judging, that he, Schtitt, knew real tennis was really about not the blend of statistical order and expansive potential that the game’s technicians revered, but in fact the opposite — not-order, limit, the places where things broke down, fragmented into beauty. That real tennis was no more reducible to delimited factors or probability curves than chess or boxing, the two games of which it’s a hybrid. In short, Schtitt and the tall A.E.G.-optics man (i.e. Incandenza), whose fierce flat serve-and-haul-ass-to-the-net approach to the game had carried him through M.I.T. on a full ride w/ stipend, and whose consulting report on high-speed photoelectric tracking the U.S.T.A. mucky-mucks found dense past all comprehending, found themselves totally simpatico on tennis’s exemption from stats-tracking regression. Were he now still among the living, Dr. Incandenza would now describe tennis in the paradoxical terms of what’s now called ‘Extra-Linear Dynamics.’ **[34]**

&gt;And Schtitt, whose knowledge of formal math is probably about equivalent to that of a Taiwanese kindergartner, nevertheless seemed to know what Hopman and van der Meer and Bollettieri seemed not to know: that locating beauty and art and magic and improvement and keys to excellence and victory in the prolix flux of match play is not a fractal matter of reducing chaos to pattern. Seemed intuitively to sense that it was a matter not of reduction at all, but — perversely — of expansion, the aleatory flutter of uncontrolled, metastatic growth — each well-shot ball admitting of n possible responses, n^2 possible responses to those responses, and on into what Incandenza would articulate to anyone who shared both his backgrounds as a Cantorian **[35]** continuum of infinities of possible move and response, Cantorian and beautiful because foliating, contained, this diagnate infinity of infinities of choice and execution, mathematically uncontrolled but humanly contained, bounded by the talent and imagination of self and opponent, bent in on itself by the containing boundaries of skill and imagination that brought one player finally down, that kept both from winning, that made it, finally, a game, these boundaries of self.

&gt;'You mean like the baselines are boundaries?' Mario tries to ask.

&gt;'Lieber Gott nein,' with a plosive disgusted sound. Schtitt likes best of all smoke-shapes to try to blow rings, and is kind of lousy at it, blowing mostly wobbly lavender hot dogs, which Mario finds delightful.

&gt;The thing with Schtitt: like most Europeans of his generation, anchored from infancy to certain permanent values which — yes, OK, granted — may, admittedly, have a whiff of proto-fascist potential about them, but which do, nevertheless (the values), anchor nicely the soul and course of a life — Old World patriarchal stuff like honor and discipline and fidelity to some larger unit — Gerhardt Schtitt does not so much dislike the modern O.N.A.N.ite U.S. of A. as find it hilarious and frightening at the same time. Probably mostly just alien. This should not be rendered in exposition like this, but Mario Incandenza has a severely limited range of verbatim recall. Schtitt was educated in pre-Unification Gymnasium under the rather Kanto-Hegelian idea that jr. athletics was basically just training for citizenship, that jr. athletics was about learning to sacrifice the hot narrow imperatives of the Self — the needs, the desires, the fears, the multiform cravings of the individual appetitive will — to the larger imperatives of a team (OK, the State) and a set of delimiting rules (OK, the Law). It sounds almost frighteningly simple-minded, though not to Mario, across the redwood table, listening. By learning, in palestra, the virtues that pay off directly in competitive games, the well-disciplined boy begins assembling the more abstract, gratification-delaying skills necessary for being a ‘team player’ in a larger arena: the even more subtly diffracted moral chaos of full-service citizenship in a State. Except Schtitt says Ach, but who can imagine this training serving its purpose in an experialist and waste-exporting nation that’s forgotten privation and hardship and the discipline which hardship teaches by requiring? A U.S. of modern A. where the State is not a team or a code, but a sort of sloppy intersection of desires and fears, where the only public consensus a boy must surrender to is the acknowledged primacy of straight-line pursuing this flat and short-sighted idea of personal happiness…

Proof deeply informed Dr. J. Incandenza’s sense of the transstatistical aesthetics of serious tennis.]","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of overwrought, concurrently preened and slapdash, grammatically tenuous but technically confident, prolix passage that is a genuine joy to struggle with, to disentangle and parse and carefully dissect. These passages are like brain-food, raw and unadulterated. DFW, on tennis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons the late James Incandenza had been so terribly high on bringing Schtitt to the Enfield Tennis Academy was that Schtitt, like the founder himself (who’d come back to tennis, and later film, from a background in hard-core-math-based optical science), was that Schtitt approached competitive tennis more like a pure mathematician than a technician. Most jr.-tennis coaches are basically technicians, hands-on practical straight-ahead problem-solving statistical-data wonks, with maybe added knacks for short-haul psychology and motivational speaking. The point about not crunching serious stats is that Schtitt had clued Incandenza in, all the way back at a B.S. 1989 &lt;strong&gt;[33]&lt;/strong&gt; U.S.T.A. convention on photoelectric line-judging, that he, Schtitt, knew real tennis was really about not the blend of statistical order and expansive potential that the game’s technicians revered, but in fact the opposite — not-order, limit, the places where things broke down, fragmented into beauty. That real tennis was no more reducible to delimited factors or probability curves than chess or boxing, the two games of which it’s a hybrid. In short, Schtitt and the tall A.E.G.-optics man (i.e. Incandenza), whose fierce flat serve-and-haul-ass-to-the-net approach to the game had carried him through M.I.T. on a full ride w/ stipend, and whose consulting report on high-speed photoelectric tracking the U.S.T.A. mucky-mucks found dense past all comprehending, found themselves totally simpatico on tennis’s exemption from stats-tracking regression. Were he now still among the living, Dr. Incandenza would now describe tennis in the paradoxical terms of what’s now called ‘Extra-Linear Dynamics.’ &lt;strong&gt;[34]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Schtitt, whose knowledge of formal math is probably about equivalent to that of a Taiwanese kindergartner, nevertheless seemed to know what Hopman and van der Meer and Bollettieri seemed not to know: that locating beauty and art and magic and improvement and keys to excellence and victory in the prolix flux of match play is not a fractal matter of reducing chaos to pattern.

Pseudo intellectualism and snobbery is a huge problem in parts of the reading population that we need to combat as fellow readers.  We are not better or smarter because we read during our free time instead of watching a movie or hanging out with friends at dance clubs.  Reading is not a laudable activity in a vacuum; if I spend my time reading bad Twilight fan fiction I am not somehow better than someone who critically watches Aronofsky films.  Reading is not sacred.  What we read is really important and we are not critical enough about what we put inside our brains.  Reading old books and classics is not sufficient protection.  A lot of classics were just the action film equivalent of their age, e.g. “The Count of Monte Cristo”.  Other classics were pioneers in raising important issues and thoughts, but now have more useful successors.  We need to begin thinking hard about what to read and why.  Too many reading lists are just the equivalent of bestseller lists for people who want to feel smart, based more on what sells than what edifies.

P.S.  I have no idea what books are worth reading, I’m still trying to figure that out.  If anyone knows of a good heuristic or resource please let me know.  It would be great to hear from someone in the field, like an authoritative literature professor, give a straightforward explanation on why and what to read, but an experienced hobbyist reader is great too.

In this post, I'm not concerning myself with the aesthetic experience of reading the story or Hemingway's revolutionary use of language. I'm mainly concerned with an idea that I believe he puts forth. 

First, a qualification. I think the story ends on an overall positive note. Although the [spoilers] Old Man does not get his prized fish all the way back to shore, he achieves something more than physical gain; he attains spiritual and moral transcendence through the effort of battling with the elements and catching the fish and killing the sharks. I'm saying  that the story ends with the protagonist having gained something. 

My main point concerns how he gained it. His impetus to go further out in the sea than other fisherman is a wound to his pride. He has gone 84 days without a fish and feels bad about it. His pride causes him to venture out beyond where he normally fishes, to attempt to catch the Marlin even after he knows that it is too big to fit in his boat, and then to keep the marlin tied to his boat after the sharks start to eat it. His pride is the main character trait that keeps him going. 

In tragic stories, a characters pride or hubris often precipitates a downfall (especially in Greek Tragedy, specifically Oedipus Rex). This is a trope of tragic stories going back to The Epic of Gilgamesh all the way up to Things Fall Apart. However Hemingway seems to reverse this principle and the fisherman's pride brings about a spiritual redemption. At the end of the story, the hero has lost nothing. The boy is still with him, his hands will heal, and he will continue his life as he always has. He has lost nothing, but gained self-actualization and lived his life to it's fullest. 

Simply put, his pride contributes to positive things in his life, but nothing tragic. Is Hemingway arguing that Pride is a virtue? Or is he simply saying that Pride can go either way? Because, honestly, tragedy could have befallen the Old Man at any point during his trip and it would have been the fault of his pride. But he doesn't experience tragedy; therefore, Hemingway seems to be arguing for Pride as a good thing that creates great men and great experiences. 

Shifting to real life, pride has been the impetus for many great men to do many great things. It seems so obvious that I don't even feel the need to cite any examples. 

Is Hemingway's concept of pride original? Does anyone before him argue for pride being a virtue? What do other great minds say about pride?

Basic context about me is that while I love the idea of classic and modern literary fiction, and have collected many books of it, I don't read it very often. The most literary book I've completed recently was Lolita, and started but not finished (but enjoyed) was Crime and Punishment. I barely read, and am not well read.

I have a mixed relationship with introductions. Some have been amazing, and truly opened up my eyes about the context of the work, the author, and where the text comes from. I really enjoy that. I read the introduction to a book of Rashomon and other short stories, and it made the author a fleshed out human. I only read a couple of the stories, but I remember the introduction just as well.

However, very often they will straight up spoil the story. I just read the introduction to an edition of The Trial. While I felt justified that it didn't suit my purposes for reading today as it was unfinished, part of the reason I lost my motivation was because it told you the ending. So it was helpful, but also completely counterproductive.

My plan right now is to treat it case by case. If preceding materials are written by the author, I'll likely read them. If there are translator notes, I'll probably read them. Biographical notes, might read them. But introductions produced by editors seem higher risk than reward, which is crazy because they're pretty high reward. Of course, on rereads, it is a lot more likely I'll read them. However, at all times, I will be a lot more willing to just read the book than I had before.

&gt;KR: You write both prose and poetry, and often in your work, they sound like one another. What is the difference to you between prose and poetry? Do you prefer one to the other?

&gt;TL: That’s like saying, “What is the difference to you between Asians and black people?” It really is. I don’t want to answer a question like that because it distorts reality and creates divisions and groups where none, without preconception, exist, and perpetuates that kind of thinking, which in other situations become, “What is the difference to you between Asians and black people?” **If you said, “What is the difference to you between using line breaks and not using line breaks,”** it would be like saying, “What is the difference to you between a person who has straight hair and a person who has curly hair?” “Line breaks” and “Straight hair” are concrete, “Asians” and “Prose” are abstract things.

My 2c: 

Lin's abstract conception of poetry and prose seems, to me, to be spot on in this contemporary milieu. In concrete reality, there are line breaks in various fashions; naming these breaks (poetry/prose) seems completely arbitrary. On the other hand, historical delineations will always have their place in academies and museums; it's integral to trace and foster those traditions.

For the record, I'm not the biggest fan of the similes Lin uses here, nor am I crazy about his bland imagination and mono-tonal descriptions funnelled through his meticulously-over-written books. That said, I liked his showing in this interview. The little flames that he spits with conviction (see his comments on Kafka) are far more interesting than his cynically contrived - wink-wink-nudge-nudge - Bret Easton Ellis act. I'm eager to see what he does over the coming years.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.redividerjournal.org/interview-with-tao-lin-2/""&gt;This was sourced from a past interview on redivider.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t want to answer a question like that because it distorts reality and creates divisions and groups where none, without preconception, exist, and perpetuates that kind of thinking, which in other situations become, “What is the difference to you between Asians and black people?” &lt;strong&gt;If you said, “What is the difference to you between using line breaks and not using line breaks,”&lt;/strong&gt; it would be like saying, “What is the difference to you between a person who has straight hair and a person who has curly hair?” “Line breaks” and “Straight hair” are concrete, “Asians” and “Prose” are abstract things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 2c: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin&amp;#39;s abstract conception of poetry and prose seems, to me, to be spot on in this contemporary milieu. In concrete reality, there are line breaks in various fashions; naming these breaks (poetry/prose) seems completely arbitrary. On the other hand, historical delineations will always have their place in academies and museums; it&amp;#39;s integral to trace and foster those traditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, I&amp;#39;m not the biggest fan of the similes Lin uses here, nor am I crazy about his bland imagination and mono-tonal descriptions funnelled through his meticulously-over-written books. That said, I liked his showing in this interview. The little flames that he spits with conviction (see his comments on Kafka) are far more interesting than his cynically contrived - wink-wink-nudge-nudge - Bret Easton Ellis act. I&amp;#39;m eager to see what he does over the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;

I often hear something akin to the old adage 'they ain't what they used to be' when literature is discussed, particularly amongst pseudo-intellectuals and hardcore aesthetes, so I thought I would see what /r/literature makes of 'classic fiction' compared to 'modern fiction'. 

Now no doubt what constitutes those two categories is almost completely up for grabs. *The Odyssey* is not modern, surely by even the most broad definition (although no doubt it could be argued otherwise) and should probably be considered a classic, not least because you are likely to study it over the course of a Classics degree, although, for me, books like *The Catcher in the Rye*, *1984*, or *On The Road* can also be considered classic works, as they are pretty old and still widely read, but will probably come under the 'Modern Fiction' heading amongst academics. 

I read *The Brothers Karamoz* and enjoyed it, thought it deserved its acclaim, but parts of it were quite alien to a 21st century reader - particularly the way relationships are treated. Now with a novel like that you can always remove the historical context and transcend to a deeper point about the human condition, that's what makes classic literature worth reading, but nevertheless, in the West at least, courtship and dowries are very much out-of-fashion. 

So I here is my question: is discussing the present state-of-affairs an aesthetic advantage, or is it irrelevant? To put it another way - does an old novel suffer *aesthetically* for being old? 

Personally, I think they do. I got a lot out of Dostoevsky, he's undeniably one of the greats, but I much prefer a modern work. In fact, I'll go so far as to say that I prefer to read works published in the last twenty years or thereabouts. Why? Because I think we are living in an age of near-vertiginous transformation. I do not want to read an insightful study of the repressiveness of social values in the 1950s, or about the need-for-greed in financial hubs circa 1980. I want to read about what intelligent, creative individuals have to say about what is going on *right now*.

I've been reading and occasionally posting on this sub for a while, in fact I rarely go elsewhere, this site is pretty depressing on the whole. You seem like a bright bunch so I'd like to hear your opinions.

I read half of The Great Gatsby after trying really hard to stick with it. I just wasn't enjoying it and gave up. I've read 60 pages of Catch-22 and whilst I enjoy it I'm finding it hard to keep track and the style of writing is one I'm not comfortable with.

There are some books I have simply stormed through: Lolita, Dune, Animal Farm, Nineteen-Eighty Four, Of Mice and Men. Whilst story plays a huge part writing is what makes it easier to swallow (for me, at least. I'm aware others read for the joy of good writing).

Lolita was very heavy in descriptive text but I didn't mind. Dune was also heavy but once I got into it I couldn't stop reading.
Animal Farm and 1984 were very easy reads - the text wasn't a barrier to the story.

I suppose what I am after are books that are described as 'easy reads'? Would Catch-22 escape this category? It seems like a bit of effort to read the text and take it in properly.

Another book, The Magus, is quite heavy. It was a real effort getting through it all but there is something about it I really enjoyed. Something about the style of writing. Perhaps I have a natural dislike towards books that are written in the third-person? It is easy to follow one character linear path and imagine the story through their eyes.

&gt;An arrow of starlings fired from the windbreak’s thatch. The glitter of dew that stays where it is and steams all day. A sunflower, four more, one bowed, and horses in the distance standing rigid and still as toys. All nodding. Electric sounds of insects at their business. Ale-colored sunshine and pale sky and whorls of cirrus so high they cast no shadow. Insects all business all the time. Quartz and chert and schist and chondrite iron scabs in granite. Very old land. Look around you. The horizon trembling, shapeless. We are all of us brothers.

Tolstoy:

&gt;I was returning home by the fields. It was midsummer, the hay harvest was over and they were just beginning to reap the rye. At that season of the year there is a delightful variety of flowers —red, white, and pink scented tufty clover; milk-white ox-eye daisies with their bright yellow centers and pleasant spicy smell; yellow honey-scented rape blossoms; tall campanulas with white and lilac bells, tulip-shaped; creeping vetch; yellow, red, and pink scabious; faintly scented, neatly arranged purple plaintains with blossoms slightly tinged with pink; cornflowers, the newly opened blossoms bright blue in the sunshine but growing paler and redder towards evening or when growing old; and delicate almond-scented dodder flowers that withered quickly.

Babel:

&gt;Fields of purple poppies flower around us, the noonday wind is playing in the yellowing rye, the virginal buckwheat rises on the horizon like the wall of a distant monastery. The quiet Volyn is curving. The Volyn is withdrawing from us into a pearly mist of birch groves, it is creeping away into thickets of hops. An orange sun is rolling across the sky like a severed head, a gentle radiance glows in the ravines of the thunderclouds and the standards of the sunset float above our heads. The odour of yesterday’s blood and of slain horses drips into the evening coolness. The Zbrucz, now turned black, roars and pulls tight the foamy knots of the rapids. The bridges have been destroyed, and we ford the river on horseback. A majestic moon lies on the waves. The horses sink into the water up to their backs, the sonorous currents ooze between hundreds of horses’ legs. Someone sinks and resonantly defames the Mother of God. The river is littered with the black rectangles of carts, it is filled with a rumbling, whistling and singing that clamour above the serpents of the moon and the shining chasms.

I saw the movie first, and while it remains one of my favorite films of all time (Top Five, in fact) I think the novel trumps it. Since I read it last summer, it has been the one book that I've wanted so badly to write an essay on in English class. 

Now that I'm through with my fangasm, onto the discussion. So, in my opinion American Psycho is pretty much the epitome of post-modernism literature. So many issues are tackled with a biting, cynical wit; big ones being superficiality, materialism, and all the funny stuff you probably saw in the movie. There's so much more though that I find in the novel to be thought about, especially concerning the psychoanalytical theories presented through the first-person narrative.

The entire book is written in a haze-like state, focusing extensively on insignificant details (clothes, food, hairstyles, prices) and becomes hypnotic until the reader is jarred by spontaneous moments of insanity and depravity. The meticulousness of describing all the little details of people Patrick Bateman meets transitions into all the little details of his methods of murder, torture, and sex. I found it to be really unique in this style; psychopaths have never felt so real to me as when I read this book. The question also raised (more blatantly in the film) is do the murders really take place, or is it all in Bateman's mind? While the film focuses more on people's reactions to Patrick's murderous confessions, the book goes into more detail on his absolute insanity. There are several chapters in the book that extraordinarily portray the character's suffering, ones that even make you empathize with Bateman and his condition. Run-on sentences galore, dialogue indent removal and random shifts into third person populate these chapters, which I think are the stand-out parts of the whole book. 

I'm currently in Grade 12 English Class (senior year in the States), and throughout the whole course we've been studying three critical lenses with which to analyze literature: Marxist, feminist, and psychoanalytical. While a LOT of novels offer insight through any of these lenses, I feel that American Psycho is a book that is so strong in its message that one could write long papers on it from any lens. Nothing is left unscathed in it.

So in Christopher Palmer's Book, ""Philip K. Dick:  Exhilaration and Terror of the Postmodern,"" he wrote ""The cultural history of the fifties emphasizes propaganda about roles and ideals of femininity.... Fay understands her world in terms of the male role and ideal, as if nothing else counted, though he whole personality is making her undermine it [i.e., the male ideal]. This is not only because she has a strong sense of power,; it is also because she realizes that male and female stereotypes are not symmetrical and equal.""

So, is Fay Hume a product of history? Meaning that, she is like she is (a domineering, complex female character) because the time period she was born into? For those who have read Confessions of a Crap Artist, Fay Hume, as a refresher, is awful, manipulating, but she also has a very good sense of truth (in my opinion). Not necessarily justice, but truth- facts from fiction. In the sexist age of the 1950s, Fay, imo, was able to see through that. She always did get what she wanted, after all. It isn't noble, because she drives her husband, Charley, to a heart attack and suicide. And, ruins a happy couple of the Anteils, and effectively changes the course of Nat's life, from a modest, happy living to a more anxious, angry one. Is she a special case due to her time period?

Or, alternatively, the more misogynistic opinion- at their core, woman are like Fay- perhaps not as pronounced, or maybe not as blatantly manipulating, but still- attempt to control men and they all act like

I enjoyed it immensely! I didn't even know what 'magical reality' was until I read it. I got confused midway through, so I researched the book a bit more and realized that I had to really suspend disbelief to 'get' the book. Anyway, I gave a friend Understanding the Borderline Mother, which she devoured. Granted, that is also a fantastic book. Not lit, though. More academic. In return, she gave me The Celestine Prophecy. I feel somewhat obligated to read it since 1-I accepted it, and 2-She read mine. However, after reading the first chapter, I realize it's just crap literature and I can't quite put my finger on it..I'll compare it to something by Nicholas Sparks. I hate to call Nicholas Sparks books crap because I know he has a large fan base. Still, once when I was in the Navy, it was the only thing I had access to in the female berthing. There was an entire, entirely BANAL chapter about how the dude baked a potato for his at-home dinner date with the female character in the book. I'm getting the same feeling about the way the dialogue and everything in this book is written. It seems to be littered with completely superfluous words. I can't quite explain what I mean, therefore I'm here. I feel like there are so many points interjected and actions explained that add nothing to the plot and leave even less to the imagination.

I didn&amp;#39;t even know what &amp;#39;magical reality&amp;#39; was until I read it. I got confused midway through, so I researched the book a bit more and realized that I had to really suspend disbelief to &amp;#39;get&amp;#39; the book. Anyway, I gave a friend Understanding the Borderline Mother, which she devoured. Granted, that is also a fantastic book. Not lit, though. More academic. In return, she gave me The Celestine Prophecy. I feel somewhat obligated to read it since 1-I accepted it, and 2-She read mine. However, after reading the first chapter, I realize it&amp;#39;s just crap literature and I can&amp;#39;t quite put my finger on it..I&amp;#39;ll compare it to something by Nicholas Sparks. I hate to call Nicholas Sparks books crap because I know he has a large fan base. Still, once when I was in the Navy, it was the only thing I had access to in the female berthing. There was an entire, entirely BANAL chapter about how the dude baked a potato for his at-home dinner date with the female character in the book. I&amp;#39;m getting the same feeling about the way the dialogue and everything in this book is written. It seems to be littered with completely superfluous words. I can&amp;#39;t quite explain what I mean, therefore I&amp;#39;m here. I feel like there are so many points interjected and actions explained that add nothing to the plot and leave even less to the imagination. For instance, the first chapter explains how the guy met the girl for lunch to discuss stuff. I&amp;#39;m paraphrasing here, but at one point, the author explains how when the food arrived, the female &amp;#39;paused to take a bite of salmon from his plate, wrinkled her nose and giggled&amp;#39;. My only thought was &amp;#39;so-fucking-what!&amp;#39;. Please pardon the profanity. Do any of you know what I mean? Can you help me understand this observation between real, quality lit and the more childish stuff?

I saw the movie a few years ago and have heard that it was a fairly accurate adaptation. It was, but that's not my point- I'd like to discuss some of the novel's recurring motifs and discuss structure, as well as talk about the book's overall message, if there is one. So here are some of the motifs:

1. Clothing/Appearance- Bateman puts a massive value on both his own appearance and his acquaintances. He is obsessed with looking good, being a ""hardbody"", with the minutiae of hygiene, and, especially, with clothes. His descriptions of people he interacts with contains almost no emotional content, but he delights in listing the type and brand of clothing they wear. Yet despite his concern with physical appearance he- like other people in his world- is often unable to distinguish between acquaintances, calling them by the wrong names. When a detective asks him to describe Paul Owen, he can only note that he ""went to Yale"" and ""wore Oliver Peoples horn-rimmed glasses"".

2. *Les Miserables*- This is one of the motifs that interests me the most. Does *American Psycho* have some sort of intertextual relationship with *Les Miserables*? And if it does, is it a cultural relationship with the musical or a literary relationship with the book? Is Bateman a sort of anti-Jean Valjean, on a path to corruption instead of redemption? Is it indicative that the Bateman's world is devoid of everything from *Les Miserables*? That the spirit of revolution, love, hope, mercy and justice are alien to Ellis' Manhattan?

3. Sex and Violence- Clearly Bateman links the ideas of erotic pleasure and satisfying his homicidal tendencies. Is this a statement on American culture? He mentions raping a maid when he was 14. How long has he been entertaining these fantasies? He eventually becomes unable to become aroused at normal sexual stimuli. Is he emblematic of  all Americans in some way, or should the reader not try to regard Bateman as allegorical in any way, but as an entirely unique case, a character study of one man descending into madness and psychopathy?

4. Love and Sexuality. We meet Bateman's mother, brother, and long-term girlfriend. It seems he's little more than apathetic about his mother, hates his brother, and slowly comes to despise his girlfriend. His romantic relationships are perfunctory and mechanical, though he seems to express a sort of envy of his secretary, Jean, for being able to love him- to love at all, in fact. As an addendum to this section and a throwback to the first motif, I'd also like to note that one of the few people he is able to distinguish from the other workers in his office is Luis Carruthers- the gay man who falls in love with Bateman. So is it Carruthers' sexuality that makes Bateman uncomfortable- or the force of Carruthers emotion? 

And finally, it's hardly arguable that Bateman isn't a reliable narrator, but to what extent is he unreliable? Does he relate events more or less truthfully and omit only those things that he doesn't pay attention to, or does he deliberately lie to the reader? And what does the last scene mean?

Still, I'd like to have another one and given the amount of attention he has received from the literary community it doesn't seem excessive.

I've gravitated between finding him annoying and feeling like he may in fact be a genius. I tend to be drawn to any artist as divisive as him. Not just in that he manages to create a visceral reaction in everyone who reads him. That's easy. I could run up to some guy eating his dinner in a restaurant and spit in his food then kick him the shins and illicit a pretty emotionally charged reaction. Doesn't mean I've done anything profound. He reminds me of Duchamp in a lot of ways. His work at times seems effortless to the point of laziness yet the intention behind it seems extremely well thought out. ""Is this art? Why not?"". Duchamp was guilty of the same sort of, what people deem self-publicizing/attention seeking stunts, as Tao Lin. Purchasing a urinal from overseas just so he could engage in the argument of whether or not with government officials( ""Art""was exempt from certain taxes that urinals were typically subject to) it was art when he could have just as easily bought one from bed bath and beyond (or whatever the 1930's equivalent may be).

He utilizes a certain technique that people find alienating(because it is alienating). He writes about boredom/ennui in a way that is boring/induces ennui. His writing is usually intentionally tedious/monotonous in a way that underscores the tedium and monotony experienced by his characters. You know who else did that? Kafka. Anyone who has read(or tried to read) The Castle will understand. Let's not forget art and entertainment(while not mutually exclusive) or still separate things

The thing I like most about him is that he is perfectly capable of writing the sort of beautiful, nuanced, wrought with metaphor prose that would instantly shut his critics up if he employed it. But he chooses not to. That would go against his entire ethos. It would seem like everything that he does is calculated and intended to illicit a certain reaction in an effort to cultivate the personality that he is trying to present.

I'm not sure how many of you out there have picked up this fairly massive tome, but I'm hoping there are at least a handful of you in this community.

(Spoilers, of a sort, may follow.) Throughout the 1,200 pages, I was riveted. Truly. Calling it a spy novel would be rather specious, and the excitement I felt was hardly ever contingent on any actual classic conception of suspense or action, but I was perpetually animated to continue reading through the night--to see where Harry would lead me, either in the often staid world of bureaucratic espionage or his personal life. I couldn't get enough. Mailer's prose--or, rather, I guess, Harry Hubbard's prose--was often turgid and could often feel a little far from true life when characters would use words like ""concupiscence,"" ""internecine,"" or ""contumely"" in spoken conversation; but that was easy to forgive in the greater context of Mailer's writing. Especially in those first 100 pages, the first *Omega* chapters, I couldn't get enough of Mailer's/Harry's similes--they were electric.

But, I do have a complaint: somehow, inexplicably, after 1200 pages, I felt like there was so much more left to say. All told, the story stretches from the mid-50s to the mid-80s, but all but 100 pages take place from about 1958 to 1963. I can't remember the last time I protested on a matter of plot, but it seemed too conspicuous here that Mailer intended to give more (obviously, he did end with ""to be continued...""). I guess I should just be a tad disappointed that a one-time planned sequel never came to fruition and accept *Ghost* on its own terms--and, I think I will after more than 8 hours in its wake--but I can't help this almost intolerable thirst for more of Harry's life.

In the back of my edition there is also *The Diaries of Adam and Eve*.  I enjoyed both of these works a great deal.  At the end of the story when Eve has died, Adam writes:

&gt; Wheresoever she was, there was Eden.

The line struck me as wonderfully beautiful, both in sentiment and execution.  It joins a list of other sentences which I adore, for themselves alone.  Some other favorites:

&gt; Oh when I was young and easy in the mercy of his means

&gt; Time held me green and dying

&gt; Though I sang in my chains like the sea.

Dylan Thomas - *Fern Hill*

&gt; A day of dappled seabourne clouds.

James Joyce - *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*

and:

&gt; Shut up he explained.

Ring Lardner - *The Young Immigrants*

I love all of these for completely different reasons.  The Twain for giving a common sentiment a heart pulling new spin.  The Thomas for its beautiful presentation of fatalistic rebellion.  The Joyce for perfectly illustrating its content.  The Lardner for its unexpected juxtaposition.  All of them, seem to me, first rate uses of the English language.

I'm curious what other people's favorite sentences are.  Although there is clearly no formula for a brilliant sentence, anyone have thoughts on what makes one great?

EDIT: Lots of great quotes here.  An unexpected pleasure of this thread was discovering lots of books and authors I wasn't familiar with.  My reading list has just about tripled in size.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading Mark Twain&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Letters from the Earth&lt;/em&gt;.  In the back of my edition there is also &lt;em&gt;The Diaries of Adam and Eve&lt;/em&gt;.  I enjoyed both of these works a great deal.  At the end of the story when Eve has died, Adam writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheresoever she was, there was Eden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The line struck me as wonderfully beautiful, both in sentiment and execution.  It joins a list of other sentences which I adore, for themselves alone.  Some other favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh when I was young and easy in the mercy of his means&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time held me green and dying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I sang in my chains like the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dylan Thomas - &lt;em&gt;Fern Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day of dappled seabourne clouds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Joyce - &lt;em&gt;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shut up he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ring Lardner - &lt;em&gt;The Young Immigrants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love all of these for completely different reasons.  The Twain for giving a common sentiment a heart pulling new spin.  The Thomas for its beautiful presentation of fatalistic rebellion.  The Joyce for perfectly illustrating its content.  The Lardner for its unexpected juxtaposition.  All of them, seem to me, first rate uses of the English language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious what other people&amp;#39;s favorite sentences are.  Although there is clearly no formula for a brilliant sentence, anyone have thoughts on what makes one great?&lt;/p&gt;

Last year was the first year I kept a diary of all the books I read, and it made me realize that I haven't read nearly enough books by female authors. Yet Joan Didion was arguably my greatest author discovery last year. 

So this year I decided to alternate between male and female authors every other book. I was a little worried this would be difficult, simply because there are a number of male authors who I want to read something new by pretty frequently. But it hasn't been difficult at all, and I honestly would recommend it. Because I have a feeling I'm not the only person to absent-mindedly overlook how often I read women authors. 

I started the year trying to read two books at once, one by a male author, one by a female, so that's why the order I have them logged at the beginning tends to be more erratic. The order I'd start books would be male/female, but that wasn't always the order I finished them. But ever since I returned to school I've only had time to read one at a time, so the order now is very even.


Here's what I've read so far this year:

Farewell, My Lovely by Raymond Chandler (started before the New Year, and finished almost immediately)

The Information by Martin Amis

Fear of Flying by Erica Jong

The Woman Destroyed by Simone de Beauvoir

Housekeeping by Marilynne Robinson

Players by Don DeLillo

Freedom by Jonathan Franzen

Bought a Pride and Prejudice today for a friend who is sadly unacquainted with Austen. I'm guessing (...hoping) the text is fine but I was seriously tempted to take a red pen to the ""Life &amp; Times"" they inserted in front of the novel. It reads as if a high schooler wrote it the night before the deadline. Memorable bits:

'Her family was typically large as was customary at the time in order to counter the possibility of early death by producing many offspring.' - Eh? *Typically as was customary* is redundant. And you don't counter the possibility of of early death by having loadsa kids, you just make sure you have spares.

'Elinor and Marriane' Typo. No proofreaders at HarperCollins?

'Austen began to feel unwell and suffered from a progressive disease, which saw her health decline.' Another redundant gem of a sentence.

'Her books continued to sell, but they were not considered fashionable, as people gravitated towards the gritty realism of Dickens...' *oookay...* 'as opposed to Austen's characters who (...) concerned themselves with matters of little real consequence.' The fuck? Has this person even read the books?

'[S]he lived vicariously through her characters...' *eyebrow raised* '...allowing them the intimacies that she craved...' *wince* '... but that eluded her all her life.' Yeah... no. 

The next one is going to be long, buckle up:
'It is interesting to note that many contemporary authors choose to give their novels period settings as their plots often rely on rules of formality and etiquette and characters must behave in a certain way to ensure that a narrative will work. Jane Austen was living and writing in a time when such rules were part of polite society and can be seen as the originator of this plot devise. It is fair to say that societal rules reached their zenith of priggishness during Austen's lifetime.'


&gt; contemporary authors

Contemporary to her or to us? Unnecessarily confusing.


&gt; period settings

Which period tho


&gt; rely on rules of formality and etiquette and characters must behave in a certain way

'Strict social customs' will do, and you just saved at least half a tree. Yay!


&gt; a narrative will work.

How exactly does Regency etiquette make a narrative 'work'? One is content, the other's form.


&gt; such rules were part of polite society

That's the other half of the tree right there.


&gt; originator of this plot devise.

Massive typo. Plus, again, what makes etiquette a plot device?


&gt; zenith of priggishness 

I don't often say this, but lol.


The whole ""Life &amp; Times"" is like this. Every sentence brings new joys, like when they mention how Austen 'always avoids being vitriolic in her prose' (ahaha); how she was not a 'romanticist', whatever that means; a non sequitur about the paintings of Joseph Turner; how the 'exploration of human feeling and emotion' was a 'relatively new concept to society at the time', because I guess there is a gaping void before the 19th century and who is this ""Shakespeare"" person anyways?; and then careening off in the last paragraph to speculate if she would have been a realist if she lived longer.


Title page says this was written by a certain Gerard Cheshire. I say dishonour on him, dishonour on HarperCollins and on all the cows they own between themselves. Either pay your interns or stop giving commissions to you uncle's cousin's neighbour's teenage son who saw an Austen book being chewed up by a dog once.

So after /u/LeJeuDuProchainTrain commented he/she had been to the archives I did some research, and sure enough you can go to the library, go through some administrative hoops and see whatever you wanna see. The Harry Ransom Center, a part of the University of Austin, has a collection of DFW's papers (some 30 boxes I believe, or in any case a lot) including emails, postcards, letters, manuscripts, etc. and they also have some 100 books of his private collection. I took tons of pictures to share here and then upon clarification they told me that the form I signed upon entering meant no sharing AT ALL, even here, which sucks. Hopefully you'll want to read about what I saw, if I tell the most interesting things.
I requested 4 boxes and 7 books, and spend 3 hours reading them.

 First, an annotated photocopied version of Underworld. The first page next to the title says *chasing a ball down the hall of mirrors*. Generally there's a lot of underlining going on, not much writing. The quote *the jesuits taught me to examine things for second meanings and deeper connections* has an arrow and *D's most autobiographical thing* written. There's a Nick Shay memory and he wrote *Memory done is present- SAD!* which was oddly relevant now with the Trumpspeech. 

*...and a certain ease of bearing and belonging, the package of attitudes and values known as **lifestyle** has *Who invented this **word***. If you read the letter I posted before, he praises Delillo's assonance and alliteration, and he's pretty focused on that here. He marks assonance in *pylons with their spindly arms akimbo*, and in *the crumbled husks of glassy green beetles*, where he adds *Gives them a chant like weight in your mind, a counterweight to float on*. 

He writes *killer dialogue* in

&gt; ""I will tell you""  ""if you telle me, then I know""
""I will tell you. I will be sure to tell you"" 
""But I forget, don't I?""
""Sometimes, yes""
""You tell me and I forget""
""Sometimes. It's not important""
""But you have to tell me""
""I will. I will tell you""
""So this way I know, she said""

*Sister Grace believed the proof of God's creativity eddied from the fact that you could not surmise the life, even remotely, of his humblest shut-in* has a TRUE next to it, and is underlined.

*Whatever the cast off nature of the materials, the seeming offhandedness, an whatever the dominance of pure intuition, the man was surely a master builder. There was a structural unity to the plan, a sense of repeated themes and deft engineering. And his initials here and there, SR, Sabato Rodia, if this was in fact his correct name -- SR carved in archways like the gang graffiti in the streets outside* has a *Delillo Himself* next to it.

*stinky wisp intermittent on the wind* has heavy assonance, marking the i's.

*There were a thousand sameshit nights when he played knock rummy with...* opens chapter -4- and he says D has great openings. Later on, first lines of chapter -6- go *The empty lot was less than a block from the school entrance, a rambling waste with higher and lower level, boulders, weeds and ruined walls, signs of old exploded garbage here and there, brown bags tossed from adjacent buildings, and this is where young kids had rockfights and older kids roaste sweet mickeys...* and he says Study his OPENINGS.

*...and the boys riding into the gushing water, making everybody happy, the stoop sitters, the window heads, the shrieking girls on the bikes and the smaller kids who separate to let the bikes pass, all happy together, and finally the kid in his brother's bathing suit who holds a bushel basket at the nozzle to frare the stream of water geyser it high and wide* earns the note *I feel nostalgic for something I didn't experience*.

So those are the notes for Underwolrd I liked. Sparse underlining throughout, mostly focused on the assonances and alliterations.

Next I saw the rough copies of the This is Water Speech. Lots and lots of reworking, but sometimes very small variations between versions, like 8 or 10 different words per page. The essence was the same, he changed the opening a lot, adding lots of preambles before the fish parable.

Then I saw some folders for Oblivion. Everything related to the Federer essay was there, in many shapes and forms. I felt pretty weird reading emails to his editor talking about a trip he was taking to go see Wimbledon with Karen, lots of back and forth about flight times, acomodations, etc. Like, how did they ended up having access to that, why is it in the collection, why am I reading it? You can make a case for reading the drafts of IJ, but this? (feel free to discuss the morality of what I did, I'm still pondering on it). I liked how his style shines through in even the most mundane text. A note to the magazine editors reads *The ""style"" of the following is meant to be a blend of erudite and casual. Some of what may initially strike you as errors in syntax, usage, or punctuation are actually intentional. I'm sure that you wouldn't do it, but in the unlikely event that you simply corrected this piece like a freshman essay, I would howl in protest, and keep howling, and it would be a giant pain in the ass for everyone involved. I am, however, eager for corrections and counsel regarding typos and any apparent problems of consistency (i.e. are the same casual type constructions used consistently enough that the reader can tell they're intentional?)*. He then goes on *Bonus: a brilliant editorial photo idea. For the cover or start of article photo, use some photo of Federer, action, maybe: it needn't be posed or specially shot- and that's half the total image. The other half is an artist's or computer rendering of an x-ray of Federer (or facsimile) in precisely the same posture and attitude as the emodied side..as in both flesh and skeleton, see? Scoff, but do not dismiss.. Dwell on it a moment, let it sink in... it could actually be really cool* And a few lines down, a single *:-)*

And on to Infinite Jest. It's really hard to describe this. There are some 18 boxes of manuscripts, undated and chaotic. Many of them are sections, ranging from a page to a couple pages long, with codes like A322 written on the top. It's clear he was building it like small pieces rearranged, many of them have notes like *add between 209 and 209B* or *investigate further*, things like that. They are usually very, very heavily annotated and corrected. Many times with up to 4 different types of ink. Sometimes it's corrections, sometimes it's stuff to keep track of things (*DON GATELY HASN'T VISITED HER YET* or *FIRST TIME WE LEARN THIS*), sometimes you can see he's looking for the best moment to reveal something (the notes about Joelle's face are all over the place, in question marks. *ACID ACCIDENT?*). Sometimes it's things *like carved out of sedimentary shale and ferrous granite and generic morphic crud* with a *check New England geology* next to it, showing the level of attention to detail. Sometimes in the back of random pages he wrote variations on the title. I saw *Infinite Jest a Failed Entertainment* and *IJ - Mother leaning over crib saying she's sorry, sorry - infantile (unless infutile is a word) lens*. I know my description here is not the best, it's just imposible to explain the chaos these papers are. It's also surprisingly dull to read, since there are so many corrections but few funny annotations. I imagine if one did a very detailed and thorough research on the evolution of certain themes or stuff like that it could be super interesting, but I spent 3 hours and barely skimmed a fraction, so imagine.

Next I flipped through Labyrinths, a selection of Borges, and All the Fires the Fires, by Cortázar. Being Argentine I was eager to see what he thought of them (especially Borges, since he reviewed a biography on him) but they were barely annotated.

Next one was Suttree by Cormac McCarthy, a book I read but I have rarely seen anyone here discuss. Now this book is ANNOTATED, honestly there's more ink by him than the printed one. First page is a small portrait of McCarthy to which he drew glasses and vampire fangs, plus a moustache. The first pages, with info on the book, the empty ones, are completely filled with questions, each one with a page reference. They are usually pretty straightforward, like *Q 128 What's S's relation to religion*, or *Q 136 S father watching horse - why is S describe as an apostate?*

There's a page I loved, the one where only SUTTREE is printed, where he wrote *NO quotes, NO apostrophes, FEW commas, Tush superhush (?) dition in narrator while characters are semiliterate, compound words - lemoncolored, riverwater, Diction highest - not stopped but ceased, not on but upon, not around but about*. He also wrote 3 pages of the archaisms he liked, I guess, words like *volute, sipe, mazy, rimpled, davit, adumbration, cupreous*. Just the single words.

Now I've been writing for so long I feel I know you guys and we're friends, so I'm gonna tell something slightly personal. There's a paragraph in this book where Sut meets a random hobo which tells a random story, which was my favorite page of the book. It goes *Used to be a hobo right smart. back in the thirties. They wasnt no work I dont care what you could do. I was ridin through the mountains one night, state of Colorado. Dead of winter it was and bitter cold. I had just a smidgin of tobacco, bout enough for one or two smokes. I was in one of them old slatsided cars and I'd been up and down in it like a dog tryin to find some place where the wind wouldnt blow. Directly I scrunched up in a corner and rolled me a smoke and lit it and thowed the match down. Well, they was some sort of stuff in the floor about like tinder and it caught fire. I jumped up and stomped on it and it aint done nothin but burn faster. Wasnt two minutes the whole car was afire. I run to the door and got it open and we was goin up this grade through the mountains in the snow with the moon on it and it was just blue looking and dead quiet out there and them big old black pine trees going by. I jumped for it and lit in a snowbank and what I'm goin to tell you you'll think peculiar but it's the god's truth. That was in nineteen and thirty one and if I live to be a hunnerd year old I dont think I'll ever see anything as pretty as that train on fire goin up that mountain and around the bend and them flames lightin up the snow and the trees and the night*. hauntingly beautiful image. He marked it and said *Beauty of destruction, badness*. I had forgotten about it and when I read it I felt such a strong connection, I wanted to run and hug him. Only happened to me once reading one of those Borges essays, one of the Seven Nights one or something like that on Night, where he quotes She walks in beauty like the night and I thought hey walking and night is like Baudelaire's Recueillement and sure thing, there was a footnote and Borges quoted that line from Baudelaire and I wanted to go and tell him Hey Borges I thought of the same thing!!! 

Anyway, sorry for that, back to the papers.

Next was Libra by Delillo, a book I loved. Very few annotations, mostly underlining but here I saw something that broke my heart, and that I remember reading on an article that came out as soon as the archives became available (and that was posted here, but I couldn't find it). There's a paragraph saying *But the language tricked him with its inconsistencies. He watched sentences deteriorate, powerless to make them right. The nature of things was to be elusive. Things slipped through his perceptions. He could not get a grip on the runaway world*. He underlined that and next to it wrote DFW. I felt so sad, recently someone posted here an article on him and the top comment was *in the end, not even being DFW was enough*, and I feel this quote encompasses so well his insecurities, the persona of DFW being different from David Foster, etc. The very next picture I have says *PRIVATE DOCUMENT - INTENDED ONLY FOR RETINAS OF PEOPLE TO WHOM IT'S EXPLICITLY SENT*, which makes me feel even worse.  

Next is another of my (and all of us) favorite book, Blood Meridian. First page, next to the title, *MORE OR LESS NO COMMAS*, his signature *(D. WALLACE)* and ""*Microfiber Torpent*"". Again there are dozens of questions, such as *Q59 Symbolism of bush of dead babies*, *Q Why the constant ref. to shadows (eg. 111, 81, 139)*, *Q 85 What's the judge* (a symbol that's an O with a vertical line on it, might mean ""opinions"") *on words?* Many of the questions start saying ASK and a symbol, I wonder if he had access to or contact with McCarthy or his editors.

The book is, once more, very very heavily annotated. Underlined, single words encircled, and a few notes like *Bush of dead **babies***, translations from spanish, an often things that are deceptively simple. Many ""*Devil*""s next to the judge and especially many straightforward comments like ""*we don't see the Kid kill to be on his side*"", ""*the Judge killed these people for fun*"", ""*the judge dances and doesn't tire*"". Seems like he really liked this book.

Finally I flipped through White Noise by Delillo, not much to say though. There's a random page, with only one line underlined, that says *This is simply great prose*, which I found so honest and beautiful. His admiration of Delillo is pure and shines through. In the two final blank pages he wrote down a lot of lines he liked, in several types of ink.

So, that's it. Believe me I'd love to share the pics with you, I actually took them for the sub, but I asked and was denied twice, even explaining what Reddit was and all of that. I ask you not to ask me for the pics cause honestly I won't send them even if I would want to. I decided on posting like this because my other post got an amazing reception so it seems you guys are interested in reading on the subject even if it is like this. Thanks for your time.

PS: his email was *ohcapmycap* at comcast.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So after &lt;a href=""/u/LeJeuDuProchainTrain""&gt;/u/LeJeuDuProchainTrain&lt;/a&gt; commented he/she had been to the archives I did some research, and sure enough you can go to the library, go through some administrative hoops and see whatever you wanna see.

&lt;p&gt;He writes &lt;em&gt;killer dialogue&lt;/em&gt; in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I will tell you&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;if you telle me, then I know&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I will tell you. I will be sure to tell you&amp;quot;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;stinky wisp intermittent on the wind&lt;/em&gt; has heavy assonance, marking the i&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There were a thousand sameshit nights when he played knock rummy with...&lt;/em&gt; opens chapter -4- and he says D has great openings.

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a page I loved, the one where only SUTTREE is printed, where he wrote &lt;em&gt;NO quotes, NO apostrophes, FEW commas, Tush superhush (?) dition in narrator while characters are semiliterate, compound words - lemoncolored, riverwater, Diction highest - not stopped but ceased, not on but upon, not around but about&lt;/em&gt;.

I was in one of them old slatsided cars and I&amp;#39;d been up and down in it like a dog tryin to find some place where the wind wouldnt blow. Directly I scrunched up in a corner and rolled me a smoke and lit it and thowed the match down. Well, they was some sort of stuff in the floor about like tinder and it caught fire. I jumped up and stomped on it and it aint done nothin but burn faster. Wasnt two minutes the whole car was afire. I run to the door and got it open and we was goin up this grade through the mountains in the snow with the moon on it and it was just blue looking and dead quiet out there and them big old black pine trees going by. I jumped for it and lit in a snowbank and what I&amp;#39;m goin to tell you you&amp;#39;ll think peculiar but it&amp;#39;s the god&amp;#39;s truth.

&lt;p&gt;Next is another of my (and all of us) favorite book, Blood Meridian. First page, next to the title, &lt;em&gt;MORE OR LESS NO COMMAS&lt;/em&gt;, his signature &lt;em&gt;(D. WALLACE)&lt;/em&gt; and &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;Microfiber Torpent&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. Again there are dozens of questions, such as &lt;em&gt;Q59 Symbolism of bush of dead babies&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Q Why the constant ref. to shadows (eg. 111, 81, 139)&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Q 85 What&amp;#39;s the judge&lt;/em&gt; (a symbol that&amp;#39;s an O with a vertical line on it, might mean &amp;quot;opinions&amp;quot;) &lt;em&gt;on words?&lt;/em&gt; Many of the questions start saying ASK and a symbol, I wonder if he had access to or contact with McCarthy or his editors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is, once more, very very heavily annotated. Underlined, single words encircled, and a few notes like &lt;em&gt;Bush of dead *&lt;/em&gt;babies**&lt;em&gt;, translations from spanish, an often things that are deceptively simple. Many &amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;Devil&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;s next to the judge and especially many straightforward comments like &amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;we don&amp;#39;t see the Kid kill to be on his side&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;the Judge killed these people for fun&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;the judge dances and doesn&amp;#39;t tire*&amp;quot;. Seems like he really liked this book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I flipped through White Noise by Delillo, not much to say though. There&amp;#39;s a random page, with only one line underlined, that says &lt;em&gt;This is simply great prose&lt;/em&gt;, which I found so honest and beautiful. His admiration of Delillo is pure and shines through. In the two final blank pages he wrote down a lot of lines he liked, in several types of ink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that&amp;#39;s it. Believe me I&amp;#39;d love to share the pics with you, I actually took them for the sub, but I asked and was denied twice, even explaining what Reddit was and all of that. I ask you not to ask me for the pics cause honestly I won&amp;#39;t send them even if I would want to. I decided on posting like this because my other post got an amazing reception so it seems you guys are interested in reading on the subject even if it is like this. Thanks for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: his email was &lt;em&gt;ohcapmycap&lt;/em&gt; at comcast.&lt;/p&gt;

It would seem that, like some authors, he has a few themes which he explores in every book from every angle. It kind of reminds me of Faulkner, in that you could say Faulkner has 4 5 themes (owning land, inheriting your forefathers sins, expiation of those sins, anger at losing the war, etc.) that he writes about in pretty much every book, and like him you could do the same with many authors (David Foster Wallace, Bolaño, Dostoievsky are the ones I've read enough to confidently say they have a few subjects they keep coming back to). However, all of those (maybe not so much DFW) are aspects of the human condition, values and feelings if you will, but Calvino's themes are all meta literary: what it is to be a reader, to read, to give meaning to what you read or create and thus how reading and writing can be the same, the blurring of the limit between both things, etc. Of course he is not the first to address these issues, I'm just amazed at how in the four books I've read he does it so well and with such a fresh take each time.

It might be the excitement of finding a new favorite author and having all this ideas reading him have stirred in me, so I'm wondering a few things, if anyone cares to discuss. Does he have more books like this, are they all this good? I am aware he has two aspects, the post modernist and a more serious straightforward one, as a critic, does he also have interesting things to say on that? Do you think he is underrated or overlooked? How do his takes on meta fiction compare to other authors who deal with similar subjects?

Words cannot fully describe the sheer drama and power of Fyodor Dostoevsky's last novel The Brothers Karamazov. It is the fullest expression of Dostoevsky, of Russian drama, of perhaps life itself. It is baffling and confusing in its idiosyncrasies, and it is dazzling in its creative use of language and the freedom of form, spirit, and style that predominates this intense novel.

Every character in this novel is richly realized, both the major and minor characters, both the heroes and the villains. Dmitri Karamazov represents perhaps the ultimate exemplar of the passionate soul, truly great in every good and bad way, intense and deep. Ivan represents the best example of the intellectual soul, and Alyosha best embodies the Christian hero so beautifully. Fyodor Karamazov, or Old Karamazov, is invigorating in his sheer evil and villainy, and the lackey Smerdyakov is so chilling in his frenzied satanism of soul that it's downright chilling. The female characters are so richly drawn and capture beautifully the essence of woman. Yes, they are extremely drawn, but they are vivid and realistic as well as literary and dramatic. Grushenka and Katerina stand among the greatest women characters of fiction, and even the minor female characters are creatively drawn so as to be attractive even in their strangeness (or evil, as in Lize Khokhlakov) 

The language is not fine or graceful, but it is creative, and Dostoevsky should be seen as a great stylist because he used the graceless style, based on the spoken word, to great effect, using mistakes, cliches, expressiveness, flights of poetic fancy, humorous voice, and weird uses of literary devices for heightened comedy. It's the best expression of Dostoevsky's manic, unbridled, chaotic, free passion, and it dazzles even at its most baffling. The speeches are interlaced seamlessly, and they themselves are interesting, capturing the distinctiveness of their speakers. The polyphony is amusing and engrossing, and it really shows its best in the major characters. Plus, the word ""precisely"" has a new comedic connotation because of the prosecutor's constant use of it. 

Having taken about five months to finish the novel (as that period remains one of my busiest time spans ever), The Brothers Karamazov is something I LIVED with, something profound and expansive, overwhelming and intimate. Its Russian Orthodoxy is strange to my American Protestant spirit, but it's attractive in all it's strange viscerality and emotion as depicted in this epic.

The Brothers Karamazov is a magnificent, theatrical, epic, dramatic, tragic, comedic, vocal, polyphonic, and Christian novel of the highest order.

I am sure that rereading will reward itself unto me again. It will be a while, but I desire to and will experience this again.

I'm a recent college grad in Literature, and my studies were largely a messy scattering of topics and eras. My own personal arch is modernism (as is the case for so many Americans), and it's an era I heavily respect. In reviewing the literature as so, it's, I'd argue, the most brutal and grimmest of fiction, but one which is repeatedly defined by hope in characterization. It's often a rather blemished hope, such as in Ulysses or just about everything Hemingway and Fitzgerald wrote, but it's still hope.

But Post-Modernism lacks hope. Lacks any semblance of Progress-To-Come. It's so brutal, so infinitely destructive, and frankly I can't stand it. As a younger person I grew up admiring these works, but now coming on 30 I just can't stomach that the central idea which is not only fueling so much of creativity but also our very own lives is so exclusively nihilistic.

I'm in some ways upset about how I cannot find any cracks in Post-Modernism, but really, honestly, I'm just so BORED(!) of it. Into my early twenties I did feel along the ways of Post-Modernism, but I've gotten older and there are tons of problems but life doesn't seem that abysmal anymore. Life doesn't seem so blank anymore. I can't be alone in yawning at the wrist-cutter tragedies anymore, can I?

I don’t know why Lolita is so taboo today. Well that’s a lie, of course I do. 

But one has to put it in context. Nabokov’s Lolita has sold more copies than Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mocking Bird, most of the Harry Potter novels, and thankfully for society, more then any Dan Brown. And at any rate, Lolita was very quickly a massive commercial success. 
          
So the more pertinent question is: when and why did it become unmentionable? 

My guess is that it has always been pretty taboo. But what I notice and really hate is that people who have never read it or any of Nabokov’s other works are the quickest to scorn it, or you for that matter, for having it in your case of books.    

And as someone who occasionally takes a book out of home, in the world of Google searching, Lolita is a book that I felt odd about being seen with. But I shouldn’t. Nabokov is a towering figure in American Literature, and a man who wrote prose ecstatically. But I did, and the times that I have read the book I don’t ever remember going to a public place with it. And you would rightfully then ask: are you not just perpetuating this taboo you are here trying to debunk? Regretfully, yes. But as a reader, after an opening page of this: 

	Did she have a precursor? She did, indeed she did. In point of fact, there might 	have been no Lolita at all had I not loved, one summer, a certain initial girl-	child. In a princedom by the sea. Oh when? About as many years before Lolita 	was born, as my age was that summer…
  
	[Spoiler alert – don’t read on if you want to read the book and haven’t] 

Given that, you could defiantly understand my reservations. 

So you see, Lolita is a sadistic pornographic novel. It also doubles as the funniest and saddest novels I have ever read. And knowing its’ likely public reception, Nabokov found it necessary to contribute to an epilogue outlining his intentions.  It should also be said, he, Nabokov, was not writing for the fiery and simple-minded libertarian any more then he is writing for the reserved libertine; he was writing for readers, and those who can read him, will be well rewarded. 

The narrator and main character: Humbert Humbert, is a 40ish European man; a spoiled poet turned critic; possessor of a private adequate income and an enormous agonizing personal problem: a lust for 9-to-14 year old girls, “nymphets.” 

Finding himself where he does: a Northeastern American city, the poor panting Humbert recognizes that the twentieth century, legally and moralistically denies him the only female thing he really desires. 
But suddenly, as if a fairy tale, his one wish comes true: Stumbling around Northeastern American small towns, Humbert finds Lolita by accident. To get her, he goes through a chaotic, grotesque and hilariously erotic choreograph. 

He will do anything, and he does. The “anything” involves marrying Lolita’s widowed mother, Charlotte, with all the lies and distastes that that implies. And Charlotte, deeply in love with the charming, good-looking, cosmopolitan Humbert, immediately sends Lolita away to camp, so the “lovers” can be alone together. Out of the sheer necessity of the lies, Humbert is to consider immediately, the need for her murder. 

Fate, however, intervenes. Charlotte is killed by accident and Humbert’s steamy, anxious plotting goes to waste. A dream come true! 

Now with his little stepdaughter, Humbert sets out on a peregrination of lechery that approaches the flights of schizophrenia. 

It turns into a nightmare. Two years and two lengthy circuits across the American scene, Humbert spirals. He is insatiable, can never stop craving Lolita, because he never really has her, only her body. In the end, his punishment: Lolita runs off with a monster. Humbert, in despair, attempts to track them; after bouncing around the country, into a sanitarium, and living in utter recklessness, Lolita finds him. Now a different person, an accomplishment for the vital force that has managed to make a life out of the rubble that Humbert’s passion created, and the monster’s activities reaffirmed. For a moment Humbert repents as her destroyer. But this does him no good. He is rushed off to seek murderous revenge on the monster.  

And as Nabokov famously said: “Lolita has no moral.” 

But all I can say is that Humbert’s fate seems classically tragic; Humbert is the hero with the disgustingly tragic flaw. Humbert is the symbol of every man driven by desire.

I made sure to bring a bottle of whiskey to sip and then leave there, as is the custom. (I even made sure it was his favorite, Jack Daniel's) Overall, it was a very cool experience as a fan of his work and someone who admires him, and I'm looking forward to discussing his work and research on his work for the rest of the week, while also getting to see things like first editions of his books and his home, Rowan Oak!

(I even made sure it was his favorite, Jack Daniel&amp;#39;s) Overall, it was a very cool experience as a fan of his work and someone who admires him, and I&amp;#39;m looking forward to discussing his work and research on his work for the rest of the week, while also getting to see things like first editions of his books and his home, Rowan Oak! Has anyone else been able to visit the grave? Attended the conference? Visited the grave of an author they admire greatly?  &lt;/p&gt;

Here are some questions that I thought would be interesting to discuss:

**1:** What do you think defines postmodernism? Do you think it's existence relies on the ideas of modernism (i.e., that it is mostly just a reaction to modernism), or do you think it is an independent movement?

**2:** Do you think postmodernism is a literary school of thought or a literary time period? Do you think Cervantes and Sterne could be considered postmodern writers? 

**3:** Is postmodernism still applicable to the present world? Will the Dada-like questioning of the literary experience ever disappear form the literary scene?

**4:** What are the main problems of postmodernism? Is postmodernism a perfect device with which we may describe the world, or is it flawed? If it does have faults, are there solutions?

**5:** Do you think postmodernism is defined by an ontological contortion, or is reliant on some other principle?

**6:** Is postmodernism destroying or elevating the artistic experience in literature? Would you consider a postmodern text art even if it blatantly attacks the idea of coherent artistry?

**My own analysis:** This is my attempt at a definition of postmodernism, taken from a response to mynamematters on my previous post:

""Modernism deals with the angst of a world that is falling to ruin. The modernist writer explores this by examining the psychological state of the individual. For the modernist, reality is universal, and we should try to achieve a ""oneness"" of humanity. Example: James Joyce's ""Ulysses"", which utilizes stream-of-consciousness to examine the life of a man in a single day.

Meanwhile, the post-modernist celebrates the cacophony in the present world, and explores it and ""plays"" with it by bending reality. For the post-modernist, the individual's journey through space and time is less epistemological and more ontological. Such a journey is complicated because, unlike the modernist, the post-modernist sees reality is relative; i.e., all reality is socially constructed. Example: Alasdair Gray's ""Lanark"", where reality is fluid and seems to echo the protagonist's fears and feelings.

All in all, we might be able to see the difference between modernism and post-modernism as similar to the difference between Wordsworth's and Coleridge's verse. The modernist is like Wordsworth; the writer tries to make the commonplace fantastic by emphasizing psychological phenomenon, whether it be melancholy, nostalgia, or angst. The post-modernist is like Coleridge ; the writer tries to make the fantastic commonplace by emphasizing ontological phenomenon."" 

So, as you see, I believe that postmodernism relies on postmodernism because postmodernism is a response to modernism. However, I believe that Cervantes and Sterne could be considered postmodern writers due to their attack of a coherent reality and a questioning of the aesthetic. Postmodernism relies upon modernism for the most part, but it can exist in special circumstances as defined above. Postmodernism is defined by its questioning of the ontological and the nature of static existence, and I would also like to add that postmodernism depends heavily on the questioning of the value of the literary medium itself (thanks to davinox for this input). The main problem plaguing postmodernism today is that its running out of fuel: in the same way that modernism relied upon a seemingly decaying world of pre-WWII Europe, the idea of postmodernism relies upon a fluid view of reality brought about by the rapid demise of the European superpower (or, in Cervantes' case, the fall of the age of chivalry). Ultimately, postmodernism relies upon the end of an era, and we not at that end anymore. The Cold War is over, and even though much of the world is in poverty, the general population are not sent off to fight wars or sent to the gas chambers or gulag. Eventually, postmodernism will give rise to more great works from South America, India, and Africa, and the literary scene of North America, Europe, and the developed parts of Asia will see a new literary movement separate from postmodernism. In conclusion, I believe that postmodernism is still art even though it critiques art, in the same way that the sentence ""no sentence can convey actual information"" is still a sentence. Now, what does everyone else think?

As someone who is majoring in a foreign language and therefore delves into  non-english literature quite often, I have always been interested in people&amp;#39;s favorite pieces of literature not written in English—whether you read it in translation or in the original.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;:  I am kind of surprised there hasn&amp;#39;t been much Poetry or Drama in this discussion.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/literature""&gt;/r/literature&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s favorite books in foreign language by language in no particular order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

since the Nobel Prize in Literature will most likely be announced in around 7 weeks from now on, i'd like to ask who you'd like to see winning the nobel and why.
My personal favorites:

**Ko Un** (83), South Korean poet. I love his poetry and would love to see another poet win the nobel after Tranströmer back in 2011.

**Thomas Pynchon** (79), American novelist. The most remarkable novelist alive in my opinion. His Œuvre is so rich and so diversified. Plus it would be fun to see him sending an actor to stage to accept the nobel for him.

**Cesar Aira** (67), Argentine novelist. His books are so much fun to read, so smart and well-written. He also would be the first winner from Argentina as far as i know.

**Karl Ove Knausgård** (47), Norwegian novelist. Of course he would be an unconventional choice here, but he wouldn't even be the youngest winner.

Fear of death.

That being said, I thought I'd kick off what I hope is an interesting thread about some of the most loved and thought-provoking works and writers we can come up with.  I'll start with some of the biggies:

The Setting Sun by Osamu Dazai -  A book about the waning days of the old guard of the Japanese aristocracy, this is about a young woman named Kazuko, her experiences during and after World War II, and the existential crises she encounters as her world changes.  It is a work that covers a lot of ground.  It tackles her evolving sense of her place in the world, the dissipation of her aspiring artist brother as well his dabbling in Marxist thought, leading to his eventual suicide, and the role of the artist - both literary and traditional - in post-WWII society.  Also of importance is the nature of the ""influx"" of western thought into her world, shown in one instance through her idiosyncratic understanding of Chekov.  It contains a lot of cool, thought provoking ideas, such as a favorite line of mine, paraphrased, that ""Men do what they do in the end, fighting and toiling, so that women can have healthy babies.""  Dazai was an original talent; he seemed not to think highly of avant-garde Japanese artists such as himself, and is deeply critical of their self-destructive lifestyles.  I would consider it sort of a Japanese The Sun Also Rises, but that may not make sense.

Thousand Cranes, Snow Country, and The Old Capital by Yasunari Kawabata - A Nobel Prize winner and a truly exceptional talent, Kawabata has a famously understated style.  His works are also about the melding of old Japanese thought with new western-impacted ways of thinking and living, and his prose is excruciatingly beautiful.  He mourns loss and mourns the human condition, and his works are a tribute to emptiness and loneliness.  Snow Country is probably his most famous work but Thousand Cranes is my favorite; his description of the intricacies of the Japanese tea ceremony are transcendant.  Again, mourning is the name of the game with Kawabata, as well as his fascination with what I would describe as ""sublime nothingness.""  A word of warning, though:  To us readers today, coming from the tradition we do, some of his allusions and foreshadowing can be a bit heavy handed.

Spring Snow by Yukio Mishima - This is the first book of Mishima's so-called Sea of Fertility tetralogy, and it is stunning.  In my opinion (not a rare one), this is his magnum opus.  A heartbreaking love story, this book helps the uninitiated such as myself better understand the intricacies of the 20th Japanese ""human condition"".  It is a story that takes place after the Russo-Japanese war about a young man from a sort of nouveau riche family reared in an old aristocratic household for the sake of social standing and refinement.  Mishima was also a singular genius, and though much is made about his incredible personal life for good reason, his art is stunning.  Beauty, heartbreak, longing, and a tenacious desire to encapsulate the Japanese ethos set this work apart.  This book is Mishima coming into his own as another Japanese writer who should have won the Nobel.

A Personal Matter by Kenzaburo Oe - This one is a postmodern classic by another Nobel laureate.  A story of a man grappling with what you have to consider as the aftermath of a bout of a nihilistic loss of all hope, it is a jarring account of human frailty and dealing with an untenable situation.  I don't want to delve into too many details because I don't want to give too much away, but if you want to read a  dark work about the machinations of a man in what he sees as an untenable situation, you may want to check this out.

Kokoro by Natsume Soseki - Another book about the changing nature of Japan, although written in an earlier era than some of the other books I've listed.  Kokoro is the story of a young man studying in university in Tokyo, and his relationship with an older man with a mysterious past that gradually reveals itself over the course of the novel.  The protagonist's relationships with his family and the ""Sensei,"" as he is called, are particularly enlightening.  Even when you finish this one, the nature of the sensei's story and his telling of it leave you with more questions than answers, and you begin to have the idea that everything is perhaps not quite as it seems.  I read this work over a decade ago, and I still think about it fairly often.

Obviously I've just barely touched on some of the most famous works of the past hundred years, the ones that I feel everyone should read, and I haven't included quite a few other great works that should, by all rights, be included.  These are books you would read in an Intro to Japanese Lit class, so they seem like a good place to start.  I would be interested in other works you guys seem to think I erroneously omitted, because like I said this is just a very superficial start.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of love among our generation (I&amp;#39;m 29, and most of us here are around my age, give or take a decade) for Haruki Murakami, but beyond him I think Japanese writers of the past hundred years or so aren&amp;#39;t discussed enough around here.

Wizard of the Crow by Ngugi wa Thiong'o (Kenya): This book is hilarious, insightful, and a real pleasure to read. It is long at 750 pages and quite an undertaking, but I don't know if there is a contemporary African author who is a better writer than Ngugi. He also wrote the classics Petals of Blood and A Grain of Wheat, which, although quite different and of an earlier era, and with different goals than Wizard of the Crow, are also highly recommended as well. Ngugi is a writer who I'd very much like to see win the Nobel.

Anthills of the Savannah by Chinua Achebe (Nigeria): Achebe is an author a lot of people have read, as Things Fall Apart is now by-and-large considered to be canon and is thought by many to be the quintessential post-colonial African novel; my brother actually had it as required reading in high school (he graduated in 2008, I graduated in 2002), which I think is fantastic. However, Anthills is a very strong book in its own right, and I find it to be the better novel. I don't know if there is a better work on the problems of post-colonial governance.

Houseboy by Ferdinand Oyono (Cameroon): A very powerful and enraging novel about the waining days of French Colonialism in Africa, Houseboy (translated from French) is one of the most heartfelt works I have ever read about the strong divisions between the colonial masters of the era and their black African workers. This one is short, engaging, and very bleak in some ways.

Xala by Ousmane Sembene (Senegal): A searing novel (it was adapted into a very fine film by the author), Xala takes as its subject matter the power vacuum left by former colonial overlords, and the greed and mismanagement by the new African leadership of a formerly colonial state. It documents, to a degree, the trouble of the synthesis of the colonial style of governance with deeply-ingrained African social and moral codes. This one is fairly bleak too, and the film, in particular, has a pretty troubling final act.

The Book of Chameleons by Jose Eduardo Agualusa (Angola): This one is different from the other books I've listed. It is a very recent novel (I believe from 2007), and is written by an Angolan author and journalist of Portuguese descent, but I highly recommend it. It is a short and fascinating story of identity, dreams, reincarnation, and reinvention, and features as its narrator a lizard who lives on the walls of a house who is a reincarnated Jorge Luis Borges - and, as I've learned on reddit, much to my delight, almost everyone here loves Borges. Short and breezy, as I said previously it is quite literally an oneiric work. However, it still has a politically conscious heart, and the relatively recent troubles in Angola figure very heavily in its plot. Agualusa has a very active imagination, and I found this book - though I apologize for the triteness of the following statement - to be an irreverent revelation.

Thanks for reading my little post, and I sincerely hope someone may have something to add which I haven't yet read or heard of. There is something about African literature, the freshness of it, the novel perspectives, that I find invigorating and fascinating.

Edit: I intentionally left out one of my favorite writers, JM Coetzee, because his works are well known and their brilliance strongly attested. However, I've not read his entire ouevre, so if there is something by him you feel belongs here, by all means let us know!

Second edit:  I cleaned up some spelling and syntax errors.  Writing on the phone is taxing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I say Sub-Saharan because literature of North Africa is usually very different, but if you loved Palace Walk or The Sheltering Sky (which I think &amp;quot;counts&amp;quot; as North African literature), those would be quite all right too, at least to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here are five of my favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wizard of the Crow by Ngugi wa Thiong&amp;#39;o (Kenya): This book is hilarious, insightful, and a real pleasure to read. It is long at 750 pages and quite an undertaking, but I don&amp;#39;t know if there is a contemporary African author who is a better writer than Ngugi. He also wrote the classics Petals of Blood and A Grain of Wheat, which, although quite different and of an earlier era, and with different goals than Wizard of the Crow, are also highly recommended as well. Ngugi is a writer who I&amp;#39;d very much like to see win the Nobel.&lt;/p&gt;

Burroughs wrote the book over the course of 7 years and was on and off what we would call methadone, a synthetic opiate, during this time. (EDIT: I just looked it up again, and it turns out Eukodol, the opiate he was on, is Oxycontin.) More often, he was very drunk and constantly smoking hash and pot. Mostly the booze.

The book was never considered a novel until late in the writing when they thought they could convince the Olympia Press to publish it as one of their under-the-table pornographic novels. So, structurally, it is barely a novel.
What makes the text seem cut-up is the constant switching between voices and accents in the text, very much in the way that T. S. Eliot does in The Wasteland. In a very limited sense, Burroughs would have labelled this a cut-up in retrospect, but it isnt in any formal sense. Southern racist jumps to upper class Englishman to scientist or doctor to 1940's hipster slang, often in the same sentence. Think of Robin Williams in Alladin, constantly changing shape as he has manic conversations.

The book follows a very loose plot of Burroughs moving from New York to Mexico to Tangiers. Gay sex and violence and drugs ensue, sometimes real sometimes imagined. There are very few hallucinations except when he specifically says there are. Burroughs hated hallucinatory drugs, so he's pretty specific about that kind of thing.

Naked Lunch is really a book about language. It's a master class in how to use dialogue, break down dialogue and how authors can hide in their work while always being very present within it. It is a book, much like it's direct ancestors, The Wasteland and Ulysses and H. H. Munro's stories, that hinges on details and culture and repeating back what is going on at the moment. You have to read it a bunch of times to get it and get why it is important.

But, despite what that one guy you know who's really into drugs will tell you, it's not a book you need to be high to get. It's a book you need a lot of awareness of the nuance of accent and intonation to get, because, ultimately, Naked Lunch is a language book, a book about the power of words to control, set world views and expose or participate in hypocrisy.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever this book gets brought up, you get three immediate incorrect statements made about it:&lt;/p&gt;

If you are impassioned and upset then of course you can express your feelings, but don't resort to dehumanizing others for the sake of your argument. 

Second, for the sake of this post, I will take a hard stance stating that I believe everyone should read difficult fiction. I generally wouldn’t argue this, but for the sake of rhetorical effect, I will abide by that belief.

As a student of literature I'm commonly faced with both my peers and outsiders expressing qualms about difficult fiction. I have heard arguments against referentiality, intertextuality, allusion, or whatever of these devices you want to name, being an impasse to the fiction because it becomes a gate that the reader must find a way to either climb or unlock. I’ve heard arguments against experimental forms, because it quells the communicative act of the novel. I’ve heard arguments for fiction as democratic. I’ve heard arguments that state difficulty is a wall to emotional experience. I’ve even heard arguments that go so far to say that academia flat out ruins reading. As someone who reads difficult fiction for a living, whose career is founded on the effort I have put into reading difficult fiction, understanding it, conceptualizing the text as a historical/material/philosophical work, and then writing about it, this is hard to digest.

Jonathan Franzen in his essay, Mr. Difficult: William Gaddis and the Problem of Hard-to-Read Books, describes the two predominant models that readers and writers prescribe to in fiction:

“In one model, which was championed by Flaubert, the best novels are great works of art, the people who manage to write them deserve extraordinary credit, and if the average reader rejects the work it's because the average reader is a philistine; the value of any novel, even a mediocre one, exists independent of how many people are able to appreciate it. We can call this the Status model. It invites a discourse of genius and art-historical importance.

“In the opposing model, a novel represents a compact between the writer and the reader, with the writer providing words out of which the reader creates a pleasurable experience. Writing thus entails a balancing of self-expression and communication within a group, whether the group consists of ""Finnegans Wake"" enthusiasts or fans of Barbara Cartland. Every writer is first a member of a community of readers, and the deepest purpose of reading and writing fiction is to sustain a sense of connectedness, to resist existential loneliness; and so a novel deserves a reader's attention only as long as the author sustains the reader's trust. This is the Contract model. The discourse here is one of pleasure and connection.”

Looking at these two models they seem mutually exclusive and there are certainly cases in which they are mutually exclusive, but in general I would say that these stances are not mutually exclusive ones. If you are a subscriber to the contract model my hope is to convince you that these elements are present in difficult fiction; you can find connectedness and resist a loneliness, you can get a sense of an ongoing dialogue with a writer. I would disagree with Flaubert’s claim that the average reader is necessarily a philistine, it’s anti-democratic and elitist sentimentalism. Difficult fiction should be for the people.

First, difficult fiction is not necessarily a text for an expert in fiction. As an example consider the black mountain poets. The black mountain poets are a group of postmodern writers notorious for their difficulty, but this stands in contradiction with the goal of their poetics: the democratization of poetry. Amiri Baraka famously stated that to say the common man cannot understand his poetry is an insult to the common man. These writers are write difficult fiction not with the intention of proving their intelligence as many would argue, but to challenge and to force the reader to think, that is if the reader wishes to make to effort to understand. I will not allow anyone to state that they cannot understand a piece of fiction if they try. Further, by saying that the average reader cannot understand it you are preventing them from learning, it is gatekeeping from yourself and peers, from experiencing something new, and an educated populous is necessary for action to take place. 

And you may be saying that if these writers want people to understand them why do they not write in a common parlance. The problem with this claim is that it assumes that a natural or colloquial dialect is capable of producing the same type of meaning, or eliciting that meaning with the same success, as a text that using a form other than these. This is the flaw. When a writer uses a word in a way that is unexpected or uses syntax that is uncomfortable it immediately prompts you to say “what does this mean?” She may using language that is a part of common parlance, but when you are faced with that word in a new context you must re-understand how this word works or what it means, and do you want a fiction writer telling you how to think about the way they are using language, disrupting the narrative, or do you want to maintain the reading experience? Consider even a simple example: would you tell a writer that they should not use a metaphor? No. So why would you tell a writer that is using stream-of-consciousness that they shouldn’t? When you understand it as a tool and what is at work in this fragmentary, disconnected, and seemingly nonsensical form, you will be able to make sense of it. When you encounter something you don’t understand it will always be helpful to ask yourself, “what should I expect normally, what type of meaning does that normal style produce, and how does that differ from the normal style?” Bounce these forms off against each, see what this other style may say about the ways you normally use language. The text is not there to show off the writer’s prowess. It is there to teach.

But you may be saying “what about when a writer alludes to something I do not understand or is constantly shifting languages; this is not form, this is a lack of explanation.” Then I say make that a part of the experience. When you do not understand something ask why it may be significant that you do not understand. For example, Gloria Anzaldúa writes prose and poetry that is constantly shifting between spanish and english. As someone who is not entirely fluent in Spanish I constantly feel alienated, but when you look at the content you will notice she is speaking of her ethnicity, her country of origin, places and experiences that are alien to the reader as well. She does not expect you to understand everything, what she expects you to understand is that you cannot understand everything, that there are particularities of her language, i.e. cultural resonances, and experience that are beyond your experience. Thomas Pynchon uses allusion similarly, his fiction is commonly placed in the genre of paranoid fiction because he overstimulates you with information; he does the work to make you think that there are connections in places there may not be. What you should experience is not a complete experience, but develop a sense of paranoia and alienation.

This desire for alienation is not always the case though. Consider James Joyce’s Ulysses, that mammoth that most people are afraid, is my favorite book of all time. It in my opinion meets every single bit of criteria for what I want out of piece of fiction (many of which are taste). It makes me feel deeply, it creates complex character, it’s written beautifully, it creates meaning through form, it’s interested in literary history, experiments with genre, confronts difficult questions and not always with a direct answer, etc. Even in it’s difficulty Joyce writes to revitalize Ireland, it is once again a democratic project, but he also writes in what may seem contradictory, is the most natural movement of language when we think. 

Saying that I would also like to say that I find Ulysses emotionally rich, not in spite of it’s difficulty, but in large parts because of it. If you would like to get a sense of emotional beauty of the text listen to this reading of Molly Bloom’s soliloquy at the end of Ulysses. Many readers try to read this section and feel it is impenetrable, but when listening it seems so apparent what is trying to be conveyed.

Another important question we must ask is, if I am not being challenged then why am I reading this? It’s a spectacle, a distraction to resolve boredom. This is a particularly important problem to confront especially in a time when technology is reframing that way we confront the world and art. This is not to say that technology is bad. There is much to gain from technology, there is much to think about and be found in video games and films that are willing to challenge the way we think about our lives. Even things like going on facebook can be interesting if give the proper thought, for example the way it creates a social space is ripe for dissection. But giving things active thought such as facebook, thinking critically about the systems in which you are involved, and even thinking about movies or video games are limited by the degree to which you give that part of your brain practice. Reading difficult fiction and challenging how you think, confers a deep educational benefit. It reminds you to think about the way things are structure outside of fiction. It is also especially important to read difficult fiction because fiction is a very unique artform, in many ways unrestricted by visual thinking that we are accustomed to; which is drawn out most effectively in fiction that rethinks the normal ways in which we read fiction.

Lastly, even though this post has been much about the need for non-expert to read difficult fiction, it is important to note that there are writers who write from an expert position and write for an expert audience. There is still plenty of challenging fiction available that isn’t specifically encoded for someone with a PhD. Saying that there is no reason that you can’t work towards understanding these texts, there is plenty someone without a PhD can get out of a book like Gravity’s Rainbow or The Canterbury Tales. 

I do not think everyone should jump into reading Finnegan’s Wake immediately after reading this because they won’t necessarily have an enjoyable experience. There are degrees of difficulty and as you dig deeper, you will be able to understand to a greater degree what is happening; you will have new tools and experiences to remediate what you are reading. People think that when you learn how to pronounce words, when you learn what a metaphor is that you know how to read, but that is not the case. Reading is a lifelong commitment. Don’t be afraid to read slow, because when you sit there over a page for an hour trying to understand, what that means is that when you do understand it, you will understand the tools that the author is using and each page after that will only become successively easier. Sometimes you will pick up a book that is too difficult and putting it down is okay if you are willing to maintain the possibility of going back when you’ve read some easier stuff in that genre, maybe read criticism that explains how these tools are working, then tackle it again. But we need informed, intelligent readers who can delve deeply into ideas and think slow, patiently, and confront difficult problems. If we can’t confront the difficulty of fiction with patience, then how can we confront the complex problems of race, meaning, being, history, science, and society that these writers are asking us to face in a way as complex as they have faced them and how can find solutions to them in the real world?

Examples of starting points for difficult fiction in various genres (Note that these are biased towards my interests and what I have read):

Contemporary Fiction: The Sellout, Life and Times of Michael K, A Tale for the Time Being, House of Leaves

Postmodernism: White Noise, The Crying of Lot 49, Lolita, Infinite Jest

Modernism: The Trial, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man

Apocalyptic: The Road, Galapagos

Poetry: Sonnets of Edmund Spenser, Spring and All, Songs to Joannes

Science Fiction: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Oryx and Crake, Dune

Comedy: Candide, Waiting for Godot

Postcolonialism: Midnight’s Children, Wide Sargasso Sea

Drama: Death of a Salesman, Woyzeck, The Condemned of Altona

Peter Verkhovensky is, of course, based on [Sergey Nechayev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Nechayev); he's a master manipulator and murderer and purely chaotic evil character with complete disregard for anything but himself. Kirilov is in a league on it's own, I'll never forget the last scene in the book with him. He's wondering why aren't there more suicides, he wants to kill himself to become God and he's ready to accept another man's crimes because he doesn't care about anything else, while also being a very logical and compassionate person (he even does daily gymnastics). Camus explained him very well in ""The Myth of Sisyphus"".

And, of course, Nikolai Stavrogin. He's a murderer, a paedophile, the most ridicuously awful person but he's also easy to empathise with, and if you read Demons (especially with that censored chapter) you'll see why. He's simply beyond good and evil; Thomas Mann called Stavrogin ""one of the most weirdly attractive characters in literature"".

I actually didn't find it too difficult to read, and while it took me about 4 months to finish (I'm a very sporadic reader), I never got the sense I was slogging through it. Definitely the most entertaining and engaging book I've read, and I feel like it will have a sort of 'Dark Souls' effect on me, in that any book I read from now on will seem mediocre by comparison. Of course I don't think I picked up on even 10% of what DFW was trying to convey with this book, which is why I know for sure this will be a re-read for me (I almost never re-read.)

A couple things that stuck out to me:

The wonkiness of communication. Nearly every conversation in this book involves some sort of misunderstanding, dismissal, or some other glitch or flaw that prevents either party from understanding each other. There's Hal and his mismatched internal expressions and external communication in this first chapter and end of the book, Gately at the end unable to communicate at all, James I. never being artistically understood. One thing that stood out to me was how everyone seemed to talk past or around Mario (especially Hal in some conversations). It really made me feel for him as he's pretty much a beacon of sincerity and yet no one is willing to acknowledge it (Mario talks about that fact himself in one of his chapters). There's the DFW quote of 'How strange I have this all inside me and to you it's just words.' I feel that theme strongly in this novel.

Addiction and lonliness. As an 18 year old drug user that's gone through long periods of depression/anhedonia, I identify scarily well with Hal. When Hal and the Peemster were talking about Hal's addiction and how if he goes sober forever a part of him will die ('But which part?') I was taken way the fuck back and had to put the book down for a sec. My drug use has been a double edged sword,  while it helped bring me out my depression and lack of interest in life (thank you weed and psychedelics), it's also brought me face to face with dependency (also weed) and has caused some strain in some of my relationships and maybe added more confusion than necessary. I still use drugs, and actually after finishing IJ I went on a weed and kratom binge for about a week, and I'm still not really sure why. I'm scared of what part of me will die if I do give up drugs forever. I wouldn't classify my drug use as a problem right now, but it definitely has been in the past, and at times its been my only friend in times of extreme loneliness.

Which brings me to the loneliness theme in IJ. I have probably a good 20 pages to say about loneliness in America, but one thing that struck me is that I don't think DFW points to a reason as to WHY we're all so lonely. Maybe because of the ineffectiveness of communication? Maybe because we can never truly understand each other? Maybe because despite all the amenities and luxuries of modern America, none of out surroundings truly satisfy us? In one way or another, nearly every character battles this loneliness with an addiction of some sort, whether it be to drugs, God, or entertainment. Addiction and loneliness play hand in hand in America, and I'd like to point out one example from my life:

Just coming out from highschool I think I can confidently say that teenagers are some of the most lonely people (or maybe we're just not good at hiding our loneliness yet). Kids (yes myself included) try to combat this in a lot of ways, probably the most obvious now is the excessive use of social media and the false sense of sense of community it brings (tons more to say on that point, but I'm sure you can extrapolate in your head), but something different I'd like to point out are the overachievers, and I think this ties in to the corollary to loneliness: that seeing no point to life, having no interest in life, goes hand in hand with loneliness. The overachievers at my school were I think the loneliest people, they were all valedictorians, involved in tons of activities, were well liked by most people, always seemed satisfied and probably could've gone to top tier colleges by the time they were sophmores. And yet I saw them as the emptiest people on campus. Their entire life revolved around an addiction to achievement, and interacting with them was sometimes an unsettling experience: the only things they seemed able to communicate about were school, homework, their extra curricular activities. I don't think I've ever had a conversation with one of the overachievers that involved non-school related topics. It was a really sad to realise that these people that were going to go on to do tremendous things never realised that there was a reality outside doing tremendous things. I personally think they were battling that gnawing feeling you get when you're alone, that none of this truly matters, all of this is pointless.

Finally one last quick point I'd like to mention: DFW often said in interviews that IJ was supposed to be a sad book, and I definitely felt that. There were days, sometimes weeks, where I couldn't pick it up because it would depress me so much. This was probably the most true to American lifestyle book I've read, and all the things he points out about America are so spot on. I would compare finishing this book to an acid trip, in that once you unveil that special knowledge, it's hard to look at your world in the same way.

###/r/literature's 50,000th subscriber celebration fundraising campaign for Room to Read###

---

**\*\*[Click here to donate!](http://www.crowdrise.com/literature/fundraiser/literature)**\*\*

---

* **Charity:** Room to Read
* **Goal:** ~~$100 (we can definitely do this!)~~ PARTY TIME! You bad enough dudes have upped the goal to $250!

**Room to Read** has been selected to be the beneficiary of /r/literature's 50,000th subscriber celebration fundraising campaign! **[Click here to make a charitable contribution](http://www.crowdrise.com/literature/fundraiser/literature)**. By channeling our strength in numbers, we can have a *real-world* impact on the study, reading, and discussion of literature.

Here is some information on **Room to Read**:

&gt;We envision a world in which all children can pursue a quality education, reach their full potential and contribute to their community and the world. To achieve this goal, we focus on two areas where we believe we can have the greatest impact: literacy and gender equality in education. We work in collaboration with communities and local governments across Asia and Africa to develop literacy skills and a habit of reading among primary school children, and support girls to complete secondary school with the life skills they’ll need to succeed in school and beyond

([visit full web site](https://www.roomtoread.org/))

**Room to Read** has also received, for six consecutive years, [Charity Navigator's highest rating in its category](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=10217#.UjUBiFFDvI9), so you can *trust* that your money is going to a good, well-managed cause, and will be distributed to those who need it, rather than administrators and bureaucrats.

Finally, this campaign is being hosted via **Crowdrise**, which means that *you can also trust that any contribution you make will go directly to Room to Read*. Neither I nor any other moderator of /r/literature will have direct access to the funds; it is managed independently by Crowdrise, which will direct funds to Room to Read.

If you have any questions, feel free to comment!

His writing style is so simple yet so beautiful. I can't think of another writer who powerfully communicates simple yet complex ideas so well. Reading Chekhov is not like reading Dostoevsky or Tolstoy, there are no grand ideas or debates, other than perhaps, the greatest of them all: What does it mean to live? 

I like to see Chekhov's opus as a study of man in general. From early stories like Heartache, in which a peasant cabby driver cannot find anyone to grieve with him over his dead son and instead finds solace in crying out his soul to his horse, as the horse chews oats, and ""understands"". To the angst we find in Vanya, angry at having arrived at middle age and with not much to show for it. Having expected greatness of himself, he has to reconcile his reality with his dreams, as we all do. There are no villains and no evil in the world, everyone does what they believe they have to do. 

In such stories as ""Anna on the Neck"", we find an extraordinary portrait of a beautiful young woman who marries a boring old bureaucrat. To him, she is simply a decoration meant to raise his standing among his social circles. And so can we blame the young girl as she notices attention she never received back in her village and powerful handsome men circle her? Can we blame her as she begins using her wile and beauty to get what she wants and gain an upper hand even over her husband, due to her affairs with his superiors? Is it her fault that she becomes a cold and calculating femme fatale, or is it a society that has delegated her to a piece of decoration for the rich and powerful men and has deprived her of any meaningful method of personal advancement? 

In another story, a peasant man weeps as he asks for the priest to forgive his daughter of being a prostitute. The priest gets angry at him and tells him to shut up and that she was just an actress. But we see through his memories that he was a land laborer for a rich family and his daughter grew up to be the play-mate of the family's daughters and was raised with the attitudes of the wealthy but none of the means. And when she is beguiled by wealthy young men to serve as their sexual education (encouraged by wealthy parents) and no one will marry her, she becomes an actress and visits her simply hardworking father, laden with gifts given to her by ""admirers"". He loves her and knows it was his fault, he wasn't there for her and she grew up with a cruel taste of wealth but none of the ability. As he weeps over his grave, he asks God to forgive her even if she was a whore. 

Chekhov's true skill lies in capturing the whole of experience in select works. Time is transitory and human beings live either in the future or the past, but with Chekhov we arrive at works that capture the transitory experience of the present in fictional works that convey the emotion, and ""truth"" of human experience. He is not a ""realist"". Rather, he is concerned with creating portraits that convey the present as well as possible and transmit timeless landscapes of human interaction. 


Any grand ideal or message in Chekhov is intrinsic to the situation and not to the story or the writer's own method. We may find vestiges of philosophy and the like but these are natural outgrowths of treating humanity with sympathy and simply telling their stories, as honestly as one can.

&lt;p&gt;Obviously Labyrinths, Fictions and Aleph are up there, but I live abroad and books aren&amp;#39;t as cheap as in the US, so I&amp;#39;d like to be sure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

I just finished Cloud Atlas (after watching the movie) and would love to discuss the book in general, and some themes in particular.  

First, some general thoughts:

I really liked the structure of the book, and was very glad that it dealt with the stories in big chunks, rather than jumping around like the movie did.  

I loved the idea of a Cloud Atlas showing how a soul passes through multiple bodies.  I believe that Tim Cavendish also used the idea of a Cloud Atlas as a way of figuring out how different decisions and influences in a life change the shape of that life.  

The idea of becoming or living on through your work, from the ends of the Frobisher and Sonmi story lines was really lovely as well.

There were some themes in the book that I don't think I quite understood, and I would love to discuss.

Islands:  It seems like everything but the Sonmi storyline took place on an island to some extent.  I'm not sure if this was intentional.  Was it supposed to underscore how alone the characters tended to feel?  Was Sonmi's situation supposed to be an ""island"" of civilization in a deadlanded world?  

Death of a Sibling:  This is another theme that seemed to be present in every story line, except for Louisa Rey's and Adam Ewings.  I would say that Rafael's death in Adam's story line stood in for the death of a sibling in his, since he was a ""fellow orphan"".  Do you think that this was supposed to highlight the interconnectedness of people?  Or is a death just a really good motivator in general?  

There are also several things I'm not sure I understand much at all.

What was going on with the Tim Cavendish story line?  It seems like it was set in the near future, but someone who is his age (I believe close to seventy?) would have been alive when Louisa Rey was, so there is no way for him to be her reincarnation.  In addition, he very pointedly doesn't have the star birthmark (although it is also not mentioned in Adam's story line).  He makes several comments that clearly point to Sonmi (calling the ticket agents on the train stem-cell clones, saying ""trees eat themselves"", and referencing Soylent Green), but also clearly doesn't feel a connection to RF or LR. So, was he in a parallel universe?  What is going on?

What is the point of having Meronym be the final reincarnation?  She is arguably a ""better"" person than Zachary, so it seems like a nice ""and then the soul became this important, heroic person"" sort of thing.  It just seems to not fit in general, though.  It ruins the starting with Adam, ending with Zachary naming convention.  She doesn't appear to have a ""happy"" ending - she just disappears from the narrative, where Zachary at least has a thriving family and is able to keep an ember of civilization burning through his stories.  She also doesn't have Zachary's connection to the spiritual world, which I thought was nice in a ""this soul has been recycled so often he can see other souls"" sort of way.  

Overall, it was a very satisfying read, and it was fun to look for differences and similarities between the book and movie.  I don't think I got everything I could out of it, though, so I would love to discuss it more.

 It's been a while and took a good amount of time and headaches, but I have finally finished William Faulkner's *Absalom, Absalom!* as of yesterday. This was my 5th Faulkner novel, and while I had told myself over and over this would be a daunting read, I still was challenged by the book not because of how experimental the prose was, but by how long and drawn out the prose was. The novel seems to capture the nature and essence of an old story being passed down orally in that regard, and the sections narrated by Miss Rosa seemed to go on forever before Quentin took over and continued in the seemingly extra Southern manner of storytelling. The characters of the Sutpen family seemed to fall right in line with the McCaslin family in terms of being twisted and tragic, although not quite as expansive. I continue to be amazed at how connected the characters and families of all of Faulkner's fiction set in Mississippi are, and one of the most pleasurable aspects of his novels are seeing them all connect as you read more and more of them, like you feel yourself become one with the community of Jefferson. The novel tackled the themes of race rather harshly, although unlike in *Go Down, Moses*, the novel tips more towards saying the destruction of the South was almost divine providence, as the multiple references and repetition of Biblical allusions (outside of the title) and references to great empires of world history from Greece to the British Empire seem to say that these empires falling are divinely guided, with one of my favorite lines coming right in the beginning of the novel in which it is said God must ""efface his name from the land"". This concept of atonement and hateful yet strangely intimate interactions with people of other races makes an incredibly bold statement, and an almost hateful view of the South, which is curious to think about when considering *Gone with the Wind* was published the same year. There is a strange sense of mourning that takes place by Quentin in this novel, however, which regrets the terrible destruction of the home and culture they seemingly identify with since their relatives and friends all talk about how great it was, yet are seemingly relieved at the destruction of the South's sins, which leads to a haunting confusion of identity. This idea has more poignancy when considering Quentin saying he is older at 20 than many who have died because of his constant forced interaction with the past, and drives the point of the last lines of the novel. (""I don't hate it! I don't!"") Overall, I feel like in its scope, the novel is as deep as Faulkner goes into what seems to be the main thesis and theme of all of his novels (The decay of the South), but the grandness of the ideas being thrown around left me numb in a sense, appreciative by all means, but numb. I feel like the longer I ponder on everything that occurred in the novel and the more I read about it, the more I will come to enjoy it in time. What did you all make of this novel?

Consider this passage from Dickens’s masterpiece *Bleak House*:

&gt;Fog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city. Fog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping into the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards, and hovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales of barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient Greenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog in the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper, down in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of his shivering little ’prentice boy on deck. Chance people on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog all round them, as if they were up in a balloon, and hanging in the misty clouds.

This passage, full of elaborated description of fog, is very unlikely to make it into modern fiction, largely due to its baroque construction, which could cause it to fly beyond the heads of many a reader today. In our quest for minimalism and a “less is more” sentiment, we have run away from proper indulgence that was possessed by many of our 19th-century forebears and, in the last century, authors such as Vladimir Nabokov, William Faulkner, and Cormac McCarthy. 

Which is why *The Goldfinch*, Donna Tartt’s acclaimed, award-winning, and polarizing long novel, reads so wonderfully today. Its 771 pages carry the beauty that marked the best of Charles Dickens — the Dickens of Great Expectations, David Copperfield, and Bleak House, the Dickens of long, serialized, incident-based stories such as these. Its prose carries a tactile weight and poetic beauty to it, a weight and beauty so often shied away from on the part of many a writer. Its story and characterization is one for the ages, so beautifully constructed and almost richly chaotic and rambling, its characters so memorable and colorful that they remain etched on the mind for almost forever (Theo and Boris come to mind, as do other “smaller” characters such as Andy Barbour, Pippa, and Hobie). 

Consider one of the opening passages:

&gt;""Chaotic room service trays; too many cigarettes; lukewarm vodka from duty-free. During those restless, shut-up days, I got to know every inch of the room as a prisoner comes to know his cell. It was my first time in Amsterdam; I’d seen almost nothing of the city and yet the room itself, in its bleak, drafty, sunscrubbed beauty, gave a keen sense of Northern Europe, a model of the Netherlands in miniature: whitewash and Protestant probity, co-mingled with deep-dyed luxury brought in merchant ships from the East. I spent an unreasonable amount of time scrutinizing a tiny pair of gilt-framed oils hanging over the bureau, one of peasants skating on an ice-pond by a church, the other a sailboat flouncing on a choppy winter sea: decorative copies, nothing special, though I studied them as if they held, encrypted, some key to the secret heart of the old Flemish masters. Outside, sleet tapped at the windowpanes and drizzled over the canal; and though the brocades were rich and the carpet was soft, still the winter light carried a chilly tone of 1943, privation and austerities, weak tea without sugar and hungry to bed.”

Right in the beginning of the story, Donna Tartt catches and awes the reader with her wonderful sense of imagery, her willingness to focus on the small and large details that makes the novel so exhausting and yet so wonderful at the same time. 

I am all too familiar with some of the harsh criticisms directed at Tartt’s style, that it’s overwritten fluff, that it’s too indulgent for its own good, that it belongs in a children’s book and nowhere near a Serious Modern Novel, that it needed a stern editor ready to purge the dross and bring the novel down to 300 pages (or even 200 pages, if some sterner minimalists had their way) rather than the horrible 771 pages, and that Tartt’s overindulgence is indicative of the problem of writers being too indulgent nowadays. 

I would express my disagreement and argue that it is largely due to Tartt’s neo-romanticism and baroque attention to detail that allows *The Goldfinch* to move beyond the mere story and take on a beauty of its own. The almost-rambling indulgence may be off-putting to some (perhaps this is why many have taken an aversion to the 19th-century classics), but the rambling allows Tartt to authentically capture the voice of its first-person Dickensian narrator Theo Decker, whose mind rambles, stumbles, indulges, and elaborates. This indulgence also brings to it a richness and a beauty that marked the best of classical novels and often lacking in our novels today (though contemporary authors such as Thomas Pynchon and Anthony Doerr still specialize in rich prose that evokes beauty and audacity).

More impressive than the prose style, however, is Tartt's genius in storytelling and capturing the authentic voices of its distinctive characters. Most of the storytelling is based on an incidental first-person autobiographical account, thus arguably recalling *Great Expectations* and *David Copperfield*. Thus, there is a lack of propulsive plotting as one would see in other novels, and sometimes this structure can be exhausting, specifically with the Amsterdam section. However, the rambling narrative is full of life and awe, even amid the apparently disorderly and fatalistic tone. I cared for the characters, particularly Theo and Boris. They are some of the most authentically captured fictional characters I have ever read. Even if they aren't always ""likable,"" Tartt so vividly draws these characters together that it's impressive to behold.

The length of the book is another positive in its favor. I am all aware that there were complaints about the book's massive length, that it was a sign of overindulgence on the part of the author, that the book needed a strong editor with a red pen to cross out all the boring parts and make it more story-focused. I would disagree with this. I would say that for an ambitious literary story like *The Goldfinch*, a longer length was perhaps needed in order to capture the exhausting and engrossing narrative that this story is based on. To pare it down in the name of ""editing and restraint"" would have taken away from the exuberant and lively richness that marked this book — a richness that sometimes exhausts and goes overboard, but a richness that always satisfies and involves. 

For long stories like these, I think author Chigozie Obioma had these wise words to say, that ""the novels that are remembered, that become monuments, would in fact be those which err on the part of audacious prose, which occasionally allow excess rather than those which package a story -- no matter how affecting -- in inadequate prose."" 

That is why I believe that *The Goldfinch* will live on to become a literary masterpiece and a classic of the 21st century, much like Charles Dickens's novels remain as classics today. It does err in its excess at times, but that doesn't take away from the greatness and the mastery of the overall novel, which remains one of the most satisfying literary experiences ever in my mind.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons we tend to revisit the works of Charles Dickens and the great 19th-century masters such as Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville is that, apart from the profound themes and stories in their works, there remains a certain richness in the style.
